<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>It is not an army that we must shape and train for war;
it is a nation.... The whole nation must be a team in which
each man shall play the part for which he is best fitted....
Each man shall be classified for service in the place to
which it shall best serve the general good to call him....
The significance of this cannot be overstated. It is a new
thing in our history and a landmark in our progress. It is
a new manner of accepting and vitalizing our duty to give
ourselves with thoughtful devotion to the common purpose of
us all.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Woodrow Wilson</span>, <i>Proclamation, May 18, 1917</i>

<small>BRINGING THE WAR INTO THE SCHOOLS</small></h2>

<p>The summer of 1917 found America realizing
that the war which it had entered was not going to
be won by the mobilization of an army and a navy,
however strong and efficient they might be. In the
proclamation of Woodrow Wilson the whole nation
was called upon to mobilize with a clear, succinct
purpose of organizing those forces of industry, of
education, of woman power, which are back of every
successful struggle of a nation in peace or in war.
The ready acceptance of the slogan "Win the War
in the Air," with the public clamor for aviation, was
but an indication of the general awakening of the
public to the truth that the war must be won by
the use of forces as yet undeveloped, or undirected
towards national ends.</p>

<p>The mobilization which teaches the saving of
our national resources, which directs the thoughtful
distribution and wise use of our products, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
cultivates the patriotic spirit of service in the boy
and girl power of the nation, properly belongs to
the field of education, not only in war but in peace.
To the schools of America, therefore, the war has
come as an opportunity for developing a closer relation
between education and life, between life and
service.</p>

<p>Our gradual entrance into the war and our distance
from the conflict have given us the chance
of pausing and surveying the situation before acting,&mdash;advantages
which were unfortunately denied
England and France. At the beginning of the war
England apparently almost wrecked her schools,
and is slowly repairing the mistakes of hurried
action in suspending the attendance laws. France
is saving her schools that the nation may go on
after the war. <i>It remains for America to use the
war to make better schools.</i></p>

<p>The mobilization of our schools is not concerned
with the introduction of military drill, whether voluntary
or compulsory. It is an experiment in working
out the relation of education to war. We are,
all of us, empirics in this experiment; there is no
body of tradition and theory to help us. The ancient
world offers us no parallels; the modern German
system throws no light on it. America, equally
with the nations of the older world, is a pioneer in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
the field. This is a novel experience for us who
have been originators only of free education in the
past or of administrative systems, not of types of
new education. Largely what we have to guide us
is some experience of France and England in what
to avoid. This negative counsel is valuable in restricting
our experiments, but is scarcely constructive
in its nature. One of its most valuable lessons,
however, is to show us that we must not take our
schools into the war, as England did, but <i>bring the
war into the schools</i>.</p>

<p>The fact that the problem is a novel one and
that it is experimental does not make it futile. All
education is experimental in adapting the individual
to his changing environment.</p>

<p>During recent years our schools have had to
consider the outside forces of the changing world.
It was in 1881 that the first manual-training high
school opened its doors under the hostile gaze of
incredulity and disapproval. Since then our educational
system has been bombarded with essays
on the relation of education to life, on practical
aspects of education, on vocational guidance, on
trade schools, etc. We have only to look at the
vastly differentiated courses of our colleges (some
of which have lost all trace of the humanities), at
the variegated courses in our high schools, at our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
remodeled elementary courses, to realize that in
thirty years the whole attitude of the people towards
our schools has undergone a vast change. These
changes were regarded as revolutionary at first.
But it is no more revolutionary to introduce the
war into our schools than it was to introduce the
laboratory study of sciences, or agricultural studies,
or courses in millinery and home-making,&mdash;that
is, if we understand the meaning of <i>war into the
schools</i>.</p>

<p>It is not to be denied that the educational emphasis
is different. The student who takes an agricultural
course, and thus prepares himself to be a
modern efficient farmer, is only indirectly doing
work of service to the State. His aim is individual
improvement, an advance which results in general
benefit to the State; whereas a girl who does
Red Cross work in school, or a boy who works in
a war garden, benefits the individual through the
larger service of collective responsibility in serving
the nation directly.</p>

<p>We are not unmindful of the fact that war is a
temporary condition, and we must not crowd out
the fundamental studies to meet the needs of a
temporary environment, however urgent the need
may be. In carrying the war into our schools we
must emphasize those permanent elements which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
are as necessary in war as in peace; we must use
the war as an opportunity to develop service to the
State,&mdash;service which may be vitalizing and ennobling,
full of purposeful appreciation of collective
responsibility.</p>

<p>In our study of the introduction of the war into
our schools we may properly shut out discussions
of elements which have no educational value. Many
of the proposals for the war uses of our schools
have been of a haphazard nature, called out by a
well-meant desire to meet the emergency. Much
of the legislation concerning itself with the employment
of school children or of those under compulsory
school age has been, and may yet be, harmful.
The suggestion of using the schools as recruiting
stations has lost value with the operation of the
selective draft. Ill-considered proposals to turn
over the vocational and manual-training departments
to the government for the purpose of making
munitions have shown a lack of knowledge of their
meager equipment for an industry highly specialized
with standard jigs and fixtures. A department
store, a clothing factory, a library, or an office
building would be about as fit for such a purpose
as a school building. The same may be said of the
use of our schools as hospitals. Our schools must
be retained as educative plants,&mdash;training munition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
workers, if we will, but not making munitions; providing
the government with skilled artisans and
scientists, but by no means converting their function
of education into that of industrial production.</p>

<p>The war work of our schools is more easily
planned in those which have technical and vocational
departments than in those which contain
only the desk and office equipment. Distinctions
must be made, too, between schools in agricultural
and industrial centers. The experiments made in
New York with "farm cadets" show that the country
boy has certain advantages over the city boy
in all forms of rural and garden employment.
We must not expect the same kind of work from
the high-school boys and girls in New York City
that we may exact from country children of the
same age.</p>

<p>The city boy may be needed in emergency office
and factory work. Instead of contributing service
as a farm cadet, he may become a "coöperator,"
giving part-time service to industry and to commerce
and part time to school, as many of our
city boys are now doing.</p>

<p>In dealing with the institution of higher grade
we find as many distinctions in service. In the
college of the cultural type&mdash;the college of individualism&mdash;it
is the individual who serves the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
State, how nobly may be seen in the English universities
of Oxford and Cambridge. In the public
schools and socialized institutions with vocational
work, however, it is the institution which serves.
This service of the institution may be classified
under two heads. In the case of the elementary
schools to some extent, and of the high schools
to a greater extent, our war work should be
brought into them. In the technical, vocational,
and trade schools the institution should reach out
towards the war. In the first instance the function
of the elementary and secondary school
should be to adhere to the purposes for which
they were created. The function of the higher
technical, vocational, and trade schools should be
to prepare the skilled students to take the places
of those who are called to military service; to
give scientific training, indispensable in war; to
assist, through courses for the blind and crippled,
in the reëducation of those disabled in war service,&mdash;that
is, our technical schools may be schools
of special preparation and industrial readjustment.</p>

<p>We shall observe, in working out the problem,
that we have offered to us by the war an opportunity
to make our schools better by bringing
education closer to life, not only materially but
spiritually. If we have failed to train our youth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
in coöperation and service to the State in the
past, the war gives us a new motive. For to
impart skill in use of hand or brain without
teaching collective responsibility is to fail in our
national duty. To our schools we must look as
the agencies which are to carry on the great
work of education in service, a noble and purposeful
objective for which to work, directing
the growth of our children into an efficient and
devoted citizenship.</p>

<p>Someone will urge: "The war will soon be over
and we shall hardly get started in war service
before there will be no need for such service."</p>

<p>Of course those who believe, or at least seem
to practice the belief, that the schools are to lag
far behind every economic, industrial, and social
movement and are to be mere looking-glasses for
the workaday world,&mdash;such people would not be
expected to bring the war into the schools until
some historian had written a text setting forth the
dates, drawing the battle lines, naming the commanding
generals, and picturing the final boundaries
determined by some Hague conference. It
is such professional obstructionists who make no
provision for the millions of our foreign born to
learn the English language and American customs
through the establishment of up-to-date methods
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
in teaching the adult illiterate. It is such <i>laissez-faire</i>
persons who allow children to slide out of
school unprepared physically, mentally, or vocationally
for the life ahead. It is such who insist upon
the disciplinary-value idea of subject-worth in the
face of modern psychological thought. It is such
conservatives who say that agriculture can be
taught only on the farm; that it is the business
of the factory to teach the trades; that girls may
learn to cook from their mothers; that elementary
courses in woodworking and freehand drawing
constitute vocational training; that algebra, Latin,
ancient history, and trigonometry are essential
features of the curriculum for training capable
stenographers. It is these people who say that
"the public schools of America are bulwarks of
the nation," and consistently erect bulwarks against
every agency which actually reflects the social and
economic needs of the day.</p>

<p>But those who believe that the school should
study the past and live in the present and strive
for a better future will find that the war brings
out for the schools not only the lessons of a day,
but the needs and opportunities of a decade.</p>

<p>It has been stated that movements or men
unresponsive to the present world crisis and failing
to meet present needs and opportunities do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
not deserve to exist. Whether the statement be
exactly true or not, it is evident that the up-to-the-minute
man or the live school or the progressive
industrial establishment or the efficient department
of government is responding to the national need
in exact proportion to the response made to the
needs and opportunities existing before war was
declared.</p>

<p>It is this responding power which is testing
our men and women, our institutions of government,
our industries, and our schools. Nothing
makes this clearer than the daily news. We read
that since the Railroads War Board has been established,
the railroads have increased their operating
efficiency 26 per cent, with the result that they are
now handling twice the freight and have 75 per
cent fewer idle cars; that aëroplane motors are
soon to be built as rapidly as a certain well-known
automobile can be; that standardized destroyers
and merchant ships are to be turned out by the
scores; that dyes equal to those formerly imported
have been evolved; that prominent men of means
have contributed their services to men in authority
in Washington; that well-known social workers are
on their way to France and Belgium.</p>

<p>All these things and countless others show us
how a military necessity has brought out the best
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
that is within us. And the best of it all is that
there is nothing which we are doing in the way
of making standardized products or in extending
the services of useful men that cannot be permanently
useful after the war is over. Our military
necessity is teaching us new and permanently
effective standards of making things. Meanwhile,
are the schools of America to fail by not rendering
service to a nation in time of need, by not
establishing permanently effective standards in the
making of useful boys and girls,&mdash;"boys and girls,"
as Roosevelt puts it, "who realize that they are
a part of Uncle Sam's team"?</p>

<p>The schools and colleges that were alive before
the war began are breathing the breath of life more
deeply now. Those which were asleep are waking
up and not only learning to serve, but through
this service learning to live. A little school in
Vermont in a report on what it has in the way of
war equipment states that it has only ten benches,
but adds that these have been used by sixty boys
who take manual training. A school system which
can be as efficient as that in time of peace may
naturally be expected to state, as it does in response
to a recent inquiry: "Our instructor has
been on the job all summer, helping especially
where the boys and girls are working on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
farms or have gardens. He has also organized
canning and drying clubs and is giving instruction
to different groups of boys."</p>

<p>The university which has extension courses in
time of peace naturally has war extension courses.
The prominent business man of Massachusetts who
for years interested himself in state Y.M.C.A.
work would naturally be expected to enlist, as he
has, for Y.M.C.A. work in France. Now if the
college or institution or individual serves in time
of need because of a habit of serving, might it
not be equally true that a somnolent individual or
school, if once stirred to service, might through
such service learn always to serve?</p>

<p>At this time the government of the United
States is going to learn how to become efficient.
The state colleges of agriculture are testing their
former efficiency,&mdash;the test being the power to
serve. Schools may now learn what it means to be
efficient by the service which they may now render.
Not an activity is proposed nor a principle
of educational practice given in the chapters which
follow but should be brought into our schools in
times of peace.</p>

<p>We are going to sew now for the Red Cross
because it is war time. Later we shall sew for
institutions in our community. Now we are going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
to develop part-time schools because industry needs
boys. Later we shall have coöperative courses because
boys at work need further schooling. Now
we are placing city boys on farms because the
farmers need labor. Later we shall place farms
on the minds of boys because youth needs contact
with nature. Now we have current-events discussions
about loans, submarines, aëroplanes, and
I. W. W.'s because the government needs support.
Later we shall teach the meaning of the same
things because thoughtfully trained people are
needed by the government. Now we are to teach
patriotism and thrift because the nation needs
them. Later we shall teach them because they
are essential in themselves.</p>

<p>Now we have extension courses in economical
cooking for adult women as a war measure. Later
we shall have it as a home measure. Now we are
bringing adult women into the schools to receive
instruction with their children. Later we shall
do the same thing because it is the only sensible
procedure under any and all conditions. Now
we think in terms of reëducation of disabled soldiers
because of the immediate need of helping
these honored men. Later we shall turn what we
have learned to do for these men into better provisions
for making self-supporting our crippled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
and blinded children who are now in dependent
institutions being made still more dependent by
the very nature of the poor apology for vocational
training which is given them. Now we have
clearly before us the need for industrial education
because the government is crying for workers.
Later we shall see the need for industrial education
because those who are to work in the industries
need it. Now we hold a child-labor law
before youth tempted by industry. Later we shall
endeavor to hold before youth better opportunities
for vocational, physical, and mental training in our
schools as an inducement to stay in them.</p>

<p>What are the schools and colleges going to do
about it all? Certainly they will not intentionally injure
the cause of education by starting ill-developed
ideas of war service. But the desire to avoid
the bad should not by any means imply inaction.
This is the psychological moment for all of us
to justify our very existence as individuals or as
parts of an institution or a movement. One could
only pity a school man who recently said: "Really,
I am envious of some of my colleagues. They
have something to do at this time, while the subject
which I am teaching can make no contribution."</p>

<p>There has never been a time in our school life
when taxpayers, boards of apportionment, women's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
clubs, state granges, boards of trade, could be
made more interested in having the schools broaden
out along lines of continuation-school and part-time
work, differentiated courses in our high schools,
physical-training courses, evening courses for adult
illiterates, thrift measures and school savings, teaching
of current events, more practical science work,
teaching of agriculture, unit courses in household
arts, and a score of other things which the school
men of America say they want and which they
are always saying "the public will not stand for."</p>

<p>Shall we let the golden opportunity for enrichment
pass until after the war, when cities will
most certainly preach and practice poverty?</p>

<p>Now is the time to evaluate our school subjects,
to bring in the new if they are worth while, to
scrap the old if they do not stand the test of
national needs. If a community will not "stand for"
cooking when the H. C. L. rises like a specter
before our doors, it will never vote for household
arts after the war. If a city school favorably located
near the open country will not now extend its
educational program to include community gardening
when prices of farm products are excessive,
it will hardly broaden out when the crisis of our
material needs is over. If a state will not line up
with the Federal Board of Vocational Education
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
for national aid for its vocational schools when its
industries are crying for trained youth, it will
never move forward in time of a normal demand.
If we do not reorganize our schools to bring in
the best while we may, we shall in all probability
be required in the near future to discard some
things which we have, without having any opportunity
to develop the new things which we have
stated in our conventions and teachers' institutes
that we earnestly desire. World conditions challenge
our schools. What is their program?

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>WAR AND COMMUNITY USES OF OUR SCHOOLS</small></h2>

<p>An evaluating test for each of our school subjects
has at last been found. <i>The test is the capacity
of the subject to respond to a national need or a
national ideal.</i> In many instances of the countries
concerned in this great war the schools as a whole
have amply justified their existence, and many of
the subjects taught have stood through this world
emergency the acid test of meeting national needs.
The scientific and efficiency spirit of Germany is
reflected in the posters spread over Berlin: "Send
your cherry, peach, and plum seeds to the schoolhouse
with your children," seeds being used for
making fat and oil. The spirit of France has been
reflected, as will be seen in the following pages,
in the work of the teachers and the children for
the preservation of that wonderful nationalism of
France. The schools of England are reshaping
themselves&mdash;in fact, are being remade&mdash;as a
result of the shortcomings set forth by the war.</p>

<p>The schools of America are to go forward. Patriotism
now has a new meaning. The principal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
from his school platform has opportunity for announcements
and talks other than those dealing
with routine matters. The cooking teacher has
opportunity to develop new recipes adapted to
present needs. The teacher of history may redraw
almost every day the map of Europe. The teacher
of manual training may substitute problems in concrete
for those requiring high-priced wood materials.
The school buildings near soldiers' camps
may, like the Washington (D. C.) buildings, be
opened for educational purposes for soldiers, that
they may take up general or special educational
work. Teachers of English may have their pupils
study President Wilson's messages of state as
models of English composition and expressions of
American democracy.</p>

<p>The opportunity is before the schools and the
children. There are in our school system three
elements which may be of use in war: the building
itself with its equipment, the school population
of boy and girl power, and the teaching force.</p>

<p>In England, during the first year of the war, all
three were called into requisition. Within a few
months over 1000 school buildings were in temporary
military use, and even on August 1, 1916,
180 elementary- and 20 secondary-school buildings
were still occupied for war work,&mdash;for hospitals,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
billeting of troops, housing of munition workers, etc.,&mdash;the
number of children displaced being 129,855.
In many cases the use was expected to be temporary,
but many buildings have been retained permanently.
The children whose schooling was thus
interrupted, when too young for employment, generally
drifted aimlessly into juvenile delinquency,
while those older, although below the established
employment age, went to farms and munition factories.
That is, the taking away of the school
building was concomitant with the suspension of
restrictions on age of employment and hours of
labor. The children of the prosperous class were
likewise affected by the departure of over 50 per
cent of the teachers for military service.</p>

<p>These many interruptions in the carrying on of
educational work were the result of the short-war
fallacy; they were emergency measures adopted to
meet a condition which it was generally supposed
would last but a few months. When, however, it
was realized by statesmen and the public that the
interference with education and the suspension of
laws regulating employment were resulting in irreparable
injury to health and morals of an employed
child population under 13 years of age of
150,000, and an idle younger population variously
estimated at from 200,000 to 300,000, corrective
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
measures were adopted. American schools must
learn from English experience what to avoid.
There are many legitimate uses of schools which
England is now employing; and the warnings of
interested English educators should keep our legislatures
and municipalities from breaking down the
compulsory-education laws or converting our schools
into industrial plants. Our aim, as previously stated,
should be to bring the war to the school curriculum
for educational purposes, not to take the schools
into the war, losing sight of their definite function.</p>

<p>In France, at the outbreak of the war, many of
the school buildings were requisitioned, and 30,000
teachers were called to the colors. The hardship
to the young resulting from this patriotic sacrifice
was met as far as possible by the generosity of
private citizens who gave rooms or buildings for
classes, and by professional men, too old for service,
who volunteered to carry on the work of teaching.
France was swift to realize that education must be
carried on at all costs. In districts near the fighting
line schools were of necessity transformed into
hospitals, often with a staff of women teachers temporarily
acting as nurses and attendants; but it
has been the policy of the department of public
instruction to regard this service as temporary, and
the teachers as conscripted for education.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>The trying circumstances under which the schools
have been carried on, serving nobly during the term
after hours and during vacations, make their achievements
a record of honor. In the country districts
where all the local officials were mobilized, the
teacher became the sole agent of government, making
out passports, requisitions, relief lists, etc., procuring
food, operating a public kitchen, acting as
postmaster, doing guard duty, and rendering numberless
other services to the community. One of
the first tasks of the primary schools was to undertake
entire care of children left without adequate
protection. In country districts the teachers were,
in default of newspapers, the dispensers of official
information, explaining government loans and giving
talks on the progress of the war. Thus the
entire village was brought into the schoolhouse,
which became the real center of the community.</p>

<p>In the United States and Canada the schools
may well copy some of the measures initiated in
Europe. That we are 3000 miles from the actual
battleground ought, for the present, to keep us
from considering any lowering of educational bars
or from converting our buildings into purposes
other than educational. Europe advises us that
such transformation is of an emergency nature and
only to be made under stress of an invasion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to consider
some general uses of our buildings, our equipment
(including the teaching force), and the activities
of our pupils, which have been made in the
past two or three years, excluding and reserving
for the most part for later discussion the introduction
of war work in manual-training, domestic-arts,
and domestic-science courses, and the part-time
agricultural labor.</p>

<p>An important use of our schools, and one which
should be made more general throughout the
country, is that of a distributing center for government
pamphlets, information cards, etc. In
New York City the various welfare committees
appointed by Mayor Mitchel designated the public
schools as mediums through which to circulate
papers on "safety first," fire prevention, uses of
various food products, etc., and thus reach the
families of the vast foreign population through
their children. The city's pledges of national
loyalty to be signed by adults were circulated
by the pupils shortly after the declaration of war.
Wider publicity can be given to federal regulations,
tax measures, employment modifications,
etc., by the distribution of notices to pupils of
upper grades, following the explanation by the
teacher. While our people as a whole read, though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
hastily, the newspapers morning and evening, and
may find in them all governmental measures, it is
nevertheless true that we shall be assured of a
wider distribution of information by using the pupil
as the carrier of it to the home. In England the
schools, as well as the Boy Scouts organization,
have served as national distributing agencies for
war-office notices, Parliamentary information, and
agricultural propaganda.</p>

<p>A portion of a letter from Sir Robert Blair,
chairman of the Education Committee of the London
County Council, to Superintendent Maxwell
of New York City, in May, 1917, calls attention to
the service of the schools in this connection.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>War has come upon us so unexpectedly that our people
not only did not understand the true position but on the
whole knew very little about the causes which had led to
the outbreak. The public press, bookstalls, and the public
libraries were considerably augmented by books and pamphlets
on the subject, and it was a natural prompting that
gave rise to the issue to the schools of a considerable number
of documents, memoranda, and pamphlets. These circulars
and pamphlets were mostly all issued within the first
year of the war. The first phase of the pamphlets is historical,
while the second became economical. The economical
phase in its first stages was concentrated on war savings
for the purpose of war loans and in anticipation, by the
provision of "nest eggs," of the dislocation that might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
occur at the end of the war. In its later stages&mdash;within
the last six months&mdash;the economical phase has been directed
chiefly to economy in food, owing to the menace of the
submarine campaign.</p></blockquote>

<p>A further use of the school population in hours
outside the daily session is that of giving help
in taking a census. In England school teachers
and pupils did most of the work of compiling the
National Register, a card census of inhabitants.
To some extent similar work has been done in
the United States, such as the taking of the agricultural
census in fifty-six counties (no census was
taken for the counties of Hamilton, Kings, Queens,
Richmond, and New York) in the state of New
York in April, 1917. Under the joint auspices of
the State Food Supply Commission and the State
Education Department a survey was ordered of
the agricultural resources of the state and of the
requirements for increased production, the details
of which were worked out at Ithaca at the State
College of Agriculture. Through the appointed
county enumerators, instructions were transmitted
to the various school districts.</p>

<p>The actual work of this census was begun in
most counties on April 23, the records being practically
all obtained by April 25, the teachers and
pupils in each district, assisted when necessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
by other persons, procuring the original facts from
farmers and making the summaries for their school
districts. From these records the state was within
ten days furnished with the complete amount of
seed and live stock wanted by farmers and for sale
by farmers; with the statements of the transportation
difficulties; with the itemized needs of labor,
fertilizer, and spray materials; and with the complete
enumeration of the state,&mdash;people, land, and
live stock.</p>

<p>Such work by pupils might well become an
established yearly activity. The practice of gathering
and tabulating information has an obvious
arithmetical value; and the interest developed in
investigating the resources of the community has
an educational significance which should keep us
from limiting it to emergency periods.</p>

<p>The comparative table on page 26 (one of thirteen
developed out of the census) not only illustrates
facts which the children obtained, but also shows
the magnitude of the work they undertook.</p>

<p>One of the best community uses of the school is
as a center for instruction in conserving food products.
With the absolute shortage of the world's
food supply, Americans must anticipate this shortage
in coming seasons and revert to the preserving
methods of their grandparents,&mdash;measures fallen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
into disuse in crowded cities because of lack of
storage room and the ease with which the fresh
products have been obtained, whatever the season.</p>

<p>Even villages which have no gas supply may
follow the example of cities and towns in using
the school kitchen, already installed as part of a
domestic-science equipment or newly supplied by
popular subscription, as a community canning center.
Certainly schools are as well adapted for the
purpose as department stores and Young Women's
Christian Associations, which have been leaders in
the movement.</p>

<p>The teaching of methods of preserving is primarily
the function of a school, and every suitable
school building should be employed for it. The
old-fashioned preserving meant time, drudgery, expense,
quantities of sugar, and doubtful results. A
demonstration of the newer methods and the opportunity
for community canning should be given by
the school to the neighborhood. Community canning
induces a far more effective conservation of
food than is possible for the individual kitchen.
Few households can afford to buy and store the
vast kettles, the perfected drying and dehydrating
ovens, which can be included in the equipment of
a school teaching the scientific preserving of food
and vegetables. As this is done almost wholly in
the summer, it would not interfere with the term's
work of the pupils and, in fact, offers the high-school
girls an excellent opportunity to assist in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
civic service of a most practical nature. In the
summer of 1917 Seattle maintained 20 centers for
home-economics teaching for adult women, the
government bulletin "How to Select Food" being
used as a textbook.</p>

<p>There have been wholesome experiments in community
canning in Lakewood, and in Bernards
Township, New Jersey. In the latter in each
school was an experienced teacher to supervise the
work of preserving performed by high-school girls
of the neighborhood, the fruits and vegetables
being sold by the townspeople to the school or
brought by them to be conserved by coöperative
canning for their own use in the future. This
service of the girls was on an equality with that
of the boys who belonged to the agricultural army.
In Kansas City the surplus garden products canned
by schoolgirls were used for the school lunches.</p>

<p>England's schools now have "open days" on
which parents may be admitted to receive the instruction
given to the children in the economical
cooking of the food which the food controller's
instructions show is likely to be available for general
consumption; also (quoting from a letter from
Sir Robert Blair of the London County Council,
May 30, 1917) the responsible mistresses of the
evening schools and the domestic-economy staff
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
employed in these schools are organizing traveling
kitchens in 29 boroughs within the county. These
traveling kitchens form practically a demonstration
set of apparatus by which the simplest forms of
cookery can be shown to 100 or 200 people. The
demonstrations are well attended, and the people
in small villages thus have the opportunity of
those in larger settlements to learn from experts
methods of making palatable the food products less
well understood.</p>

<p>It may be urged that community canning has its
place outside cities of the first class. New York
City certainly cannot be held to be the center of
an agricultural district, and yet valuable experiments
in food conservation are being made there.
One is concerned primarily with the prevention of
waste. Of the thousands of pounds of perishable
vegetables and fruit which are brought each day to
the produce piers, much is prohibited from being
sold to retailers because of injuries received in transportation.
When more than 20 per cent has been
injured, it has not paid wholesalers to salvage the
uninjured portion. As a result, a ruinous quantity
of produce has gone to waste, often being dumped
in the harbor for want of better disposal. The
loss as estimated by the board of health has been
225,000 pounds a week.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>To save this food by making quick use of it, in
July, 1917, Mayor Mitchel's Committee of Women
on National Defense opened a conservation kitchen
in a disused school building in the Williamsburg
Bridge section. Here the uncertain quantity of
vegetables salvaged from the produce piers was
brought to the school, picked over, and sterilized,
partly by paid labor, partly by the volunteer labor
of members of the Women's University Club and
other organizations, or city women who were willing
to contribute their labor in the cause of food saving.
This work was aided by the State Food Supply
Commission and New York's board of health,
one of whose inspectors passed judgment on the
food used in the canning and drying experiments.
The salvaged food was brought from the piers to
the kitchens by Boy Scouts, ubiquitously useful in
any public undertaking. If it had not been that
the kitchen was opened in vacation, the school
population would have had its share of work to
do. To this kitchen any woman might go to be
taught processes or actually to can produce.</p>

<p>While it was not possible to use all the produce
brought in, even by keeping the kitchen as full of
workers as space would allow and cooking as much
as 480 gallons of food at a time, the work in this
old school building is illustrative of what can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
done in community centers to eliminate waste, and
is a vital example of the efficient use of a school
building in vacation. The cost in this case was
met by special contributions of organizations and
individuals. But in smaller places this work might
be maintained by the town itself on a less elaborate
scale. Such work should not be limited to the
war period. It is a practical and efficient plan for
all time.</p>

<p>The continued war will undoubtedly increase not
only the price but the scarcity of cotton and woolen
goods. Where it has hitherto not paid to make
over clothing repeatedly because of the cheapness
and ease with which new garments and children's
wear have been procured, it is now important to
understand thrifty saving of all kinds of fabrics
and apparel.</p>

<p>Home-economics women of Berkeley, California,
aided in collecting and making over old clothing.
In Portland, Oregon, a cleaner and dyer took as his
bit of service the cleaning and disinfecting of all the
clothing which was remade by the school children.</p>

<p>In England's county schools there have been
held exhibitions of thrift, to show children when
and how economies can be practiced. Some of the
examples shown under the heading of "Utilization
of Waste Material" were as follows: old linen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
collars and cuffs made into baggage labels, window
cleaners made from pieces of old gloves, house slippers
made from old felt hats, mops made of bits
of rags fastened to a nail. Ways were shown of
making use of scraps of wool left over from knitting,
the wasting of an inch of wool being regarded
as treasonable in the country's shortage; methods
of refooting stockings were also displayed, as well as
many uses for pieces of worn table and bed linen
and old carpets.</p>

<p>In times of normal plenty such exhibitions would
not attract attention, but no greater evidence of
the reduced state of a nation at war can be had
than the seriousness with which these exhibitions
of household thrift have been viewed by the population.
A clipping from a newspaper of rural England
requests that children go into the pastures
and pick from the bushes the bits of wool which
the sheep have rubbed off.</p>

<p>For several years, at least, there will be high
prices and scarcity of materials. Our children must
be taught the necessity of preventing waste of
fabrics as well as of food. Millions of dollars worth
of cotton and wool have been destroyed in military
and munition use. But it is not only because war
conditions have made material scarce and high that
thrift in their use must be insisted upon in every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
household; we must remember that billions of dollars
will be required to pay for this war and each
household will be required to make its contribution.
Expenditures in every direction must be curbed
and the wise disposition of every dollar must be
made. A year or so ago the Bankers Association
of America launched a campaign for thrift teaching.
We were then told that, as individuals, we must
save for the future. The present high cost of living
shows that we are obliged to save in the present
in order to live in the present, but the future
will tell us to save in order that we, as a nation,
may pay for the war.</p>

<p>Many community services may be rendered during
the war by the principal of a school. He may,
as has been done, organize patriotic meetings, enlisting
the aid of the churches and arousing the
interest of chambers of commerce, civic clubs, and
women's clubs in the Red Cross, the Liberty Loan,
and school war gardens. His assembly exercises
may be made vital through talks to the pupils on
opportunities for war service; through platform recognition
of boys and girls rendering special farm,
garden, Red Cross, and food-conservation help; by
placing on a conspicuous bulletin a roll of honor
of graduates and students engaged in such work;
by keeping the school in touch with graduates who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
are enlisted in the army and navy by reading their
letters to the school and sending school packets to
them. He may advise economy in the use of foods
and clothing, the elimination of expenditures in
soda water, ice cream, and gum, and the sacrifice
of pleasure for national ends. He may urge the use
of savings in the purchase of government bonds
and war-savings certificates. Where the school has
been raising money for pictures or a phonograph,
he may suggest that the funds raised be used for
the purchase of one or more government bonds,
to be held by the school as an asset until the close
of the war, when the bond may be sold and the
money used for its original purpose of buying the
phonograph or pictures. In the case of some private
secondary schools, and large public schools
like the Washington Irving and DeWitt Clinton
high schools, New York, the pupils and teachers
have subscribed money and given entertainments
for the purchase of an ambulance, the gift of the
school to the American Expeditionary Force. In
one New York City school, through the efforts of
a student organization, Liberty Loan bonds to the
amount of $479,800 were sold.</p>

<p>The principal in country districts should make
himself fully informed of the details of the federal
farm-loan plan, the sources of available seed supply,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the posters and bulletins of nation and state regarding
the mobilization of schools and colleges,
and, of course, he should be especially active in
encouraging the home-garden projects.</p>

<p>A correspondent in the London <i>Times</i>, June 14,
1917, writing of that indispensable teaching of thrift
in household affairs, of making the present generation
of young girls intelligently self-sufficient in
domestic and industrial life, cries, "This brings us
to the crux of the whole situation: Who shall teach
the teachers?" The government and state bulletins
on food production and conservation, the literature
sent out by state councils of defense and
public safety on improved methods of preserving,
the pronouncements by banking houses on thrift
measures and means of attaining them, the Boy
Scouts, Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. leaflets on war
gardens and food economies are, in America,
beginning to answer this question.</p>

<p>Assuredly the war places an additional burden
on the teachers and gives them a new opportunity
for educating the pupils. A teacher does not
have to belong to the department of domestic
arts and science to organize Red Cross circles
nor to instruct girls in food conservation. A ten-minute
talk each morning by teacher or pupils,
before the opening of school, with discussion on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
such topics as "Why a man with a hundred dollars
to invest should buy a Liberty Bond," "New
occupations open to women because of the war,"
"The reason for the scarcity of certain products,"
"Home substitutes for various manufactured
necessities," and many others suggested by
new conditions should be very helpful.</p>

<p>An unusually significant experiment known as
the "War Savings" movement has been made in
English schools. On May 5, 1916, the Board of
Education issued a circular asking for the assistance
of local education authorities in making
known through public elementary schools the
facilities afforded by the issue of War Savings
certificates. Then, with the coöperation of these
authorities and teachers, special lessons were given
on the subject, and copies of a leaflet explaining
the purpose of the War Savings Association were
widely distributed to the parents through their
children. As a result a large number of War Savings
associations were formed in direct connection
with the schools. The success of the movement
is evident from the records given in the report of
the Board of Education for 1915-1916. In one
populous midland county the great majority of the
schools have established associations; in another, a
northern county, some 70 per cent of the schools
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
have taken part and record nearly 10,000 subscribers.
In one midland town a school of about
1400 children purchased certificates to the value
of £585 in three months. But it is not only
in large schools that the pupils have contributed
generously; a remote little school in a northern
county, with only 10 children on its register, has
10 subscribers to its credit and has saved £35,
buying 43 certificates.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that successive issues of bonds
must be made by the United States and other governments
of the world, this method of making subscription
to the war loan popular is worthy of
attention. The public schools have, as never before,
the opportunity of showing the practical value of
investing, in peace as well as in war time, in government
and other bonds. Pupils should realize
the difference between money invested in a way
to be beneficial not only to the investor but to
his state and country, and money invested in
ordinary channels.</p>

<p>New York State teachers had an opportunity
similar to those of England. The Regents of the
University of the state of New York gave formal
approval of a plan by which teachers throughout
the public schools of the state could aid the Liberty
Loan committee of the Federal Reserve Bank in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
giving instruction and information about the second
Liberty Loan. A special committee was appointed
by the Board of Regents to act in a supervisory
capacity to keep the State Education Department
in touch with the large financial interests conducting
the loan. The secretary to Commissioner
Finley, as the representative of the Regents and
the State Education Department, was assigned for
temporary services in the office of the Loan
committee.</p>

<p>The program in brief was to have the teachers
act as agents for subscriptions for the Liberty Loan.
They distributed blanks to pupils in the school,
who in turn took them to their parents. They
were encouraged to subscribe themselves. They
did not handle any money or checks, but turned
the subscription blanks over to the local bank,
which was, of course, in direct touch with the Loan
committee in New York City.</p>

<p>A primer of instruction for teachers was prepared
in the simplest possible terms. As published
by the Publicity Bureau of the United States
Treasury Department it was called "A Source
Book of the Second Liberty Loan." This primer
explained in detail the nature of the bonds, their
security, and the terms and prices; it described
the nature of bond markets in general, the sources
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
from which interest is paid, the previous records
of United States bonds, and all other matter which
was of value in elementary financial instruction. It
was all set forth in a way which was very helpful
not only in assisting in the sale of bonds but in
the larger sense of furthering instruction in bonds,
interest, discounts, etc., in connection with work
in arithmetic. And in what better way could arithmetical
instruction be furthered?</p>

<p>It is highly probable that this plan of informing
the public relative to government issues of bonds
and certificates, initiated in New York, will extend
to all parts of the country in connection with the
next Loan campaign.</p>

<p>How the responsibility of the teacher has been
met in France is in part suggestive. The teachers
have collected large funds to finance the enterprise
of caring for thousands of families of Belgian and
French refugees. They also collected from the
civilian population several millions of francs, the
teachers taxing themselves according to a fixed
schedule. They have been especially successful in
bringing to light for investment stores of hidden
gold in the homes of provincial savers. Surprising
results have been attained through their
persistent, methodical propaganda. In one large
provincial town, after a talk to the older pupils by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
the mistress of the school, in four days an amount
equal to 7200 francs was brought in. In the same
school the following composition was given out to
the pupils as part of an admission examination
in penmanship.</p>

<h3>THE GOLD OF FRANCE<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></h3>

<p>France has need of its gold to defend its invaded territory.
It is a sacred duty for every French man and woman,
rich or poor, to send to the coffers of the State the hundreds
of louis from their strong boxes, the few louis hidden in
the linen chest at home, even the single louis in the children's
toy bank. To keep in one's own possession, selfishly,
the money which could serve our dear France is a
crime against patriotism. So, little girls, do not hesitate
to break open your banks, even if they have only a half
louis inside, and gladly take in exchange the note which
the Bank of France will give you. More than that, in your
vacation in the country, set yourselves to get grandmother
to empty her stocking,&mdash;she is sometimes rather stingy
with her money. But you know well enough how to coax
those who love you when you want a toy, or ornament, or
bonbons. Use your influence with your grandparents now,
so that they will bring into the public treasury the gold
of France. In this way you will have contributed to the
coming victory that we are all hoping for, you will have
helped our brave soldiers to clear away the German whose
presence defiles our land. Go, then, all of you! Hunt out
all the money that is lying idle. It is for France!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>Thus the schools have worked to bring to light
the hoarded gold of thrifty peasants for investment
in the national loan.</p>

<p>Tangible as this service of the teachers has been
to France, of greater importance has been their
work of making clear to the villages the cause of
France. In November, 1914, the Department of
Public Instruction sent out an appeal to the
professional and volunteer teachers in the secondary
schools, saying that the schools must adapt
their program to the duties and needs created by
the hostilities.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The teachers will do their best to make the schools
serve in the national defense. In the evenings the old
men, the youths, and the women will gather together, and
the teachers will tell them the news, explain things that
happen, speak to them of patriotism, and read to them
from our writers whose pages are inspired with the glorious
deeds of our history past and present.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is reported that in the girls' schools in France
war has changed the whole aspect of education.
History, geography, lectures on literature, subjects
for literary composition or moral instruction,&mdash;in
fact everything,&mdash;is treated from the point of view
of country and of patriotic duty. In music practically
nothing is sung but the "Marseillaise," the "Chant
du Depart," and the national songs of the Allies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
Reading is confined often to official military orders
and reports, while drawings are usually of war
material or characters.</p>

<p>It is no less the duty of our teachers to make
clear to their pupils the "cause" of America. Soon
after the opening of the European war a United
States senator traveled through the belligerent
countries. His articles on Europe at war commented
caustically on the ignorance of the English
working people of the cause of the war, and of the
purpose for which the Allies were fighting. An
article on America at war could truthfully contain
like criticism of a considerable portion of
our population.</p>

<p>Shortly after the United States entered the war
a teacher in one of our largest city high schools,
where a large proportion of the pupils are of either
foreign birth or foreign parentage, asked 200 pupils
of from 14 to 18 years to write a brief statement of
what they considered to be the cause of America's
entrance into the war. While these answers covered
an incredible range of inaccuracy, not one showed
an understanding of the events which led to the
declaration of April, 1917. "Congress has declared
war so that the rich folks can get richer," "We
are at war because this is a rich man's country,"
predominated as replies. When asked what a citizen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
owed his country in return for political and religious
freedom, students replied in as vague and
cynical a way as to the first question.</p>

<p>To combat this ignorance of national motives
the teacher distributed copies of President Wilson's
address of April 2, with the ostensible purpose of
analyzing it as an exercise in argument and exposition,&mdash;a
study which finally resulted in enabling
these students to make intelligent, if occasionally
unsympathetic, answers to questions regarding the
nation's action and policy.</p>

<p>Now to residents of favored parts of the country
where the population is English speaking and
largely American born, inheriting American ideals
and traditions, the ignorance of these high-school
pupils seems exceptional, but educators know from
experiments made in colleges and secondary institutions
that the majority of students are not intelligent
on modern events of national significance,
any more than is the average worker. Nearly all
high schools have in their curriculum the study
of current events, whether in history or oral English
courses. It is the duty of the teacher to use
the study in such a manner as to obtain a patriotic
reaction to the topics presented and discussed,
and in this manner to make clear why we are
fighting and what we are fighting for.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>Out of this war we must obtain a new spirit of
patriotism. Now is the time to strike. Events
depicted in the daily press show how great is the
need. In this connection the Council of Defense
of Connecticut, in an effective campaign working
through the schools, states in a recent publication:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The war is bound to have a deep influence on American
life and thought, and we should be watchful to direct this
into right channels. The country is shot through and
through with the one-sided philosophy that the State is an
institution to be leaned upon and filched from, but not to
be served. The schools should train the children in the
fundamental contract between citizen and State. The idea
of mutuality should be developed. The State owes duties
to the citizen, but the citizen owes reciprocal duties to
the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>In September, 1914, as soon after the declaration
of war as military and agricultural conditions would
permit the schools to open, the French Minister of
Public Instruction sent an official circular to all of
the schools. He stated that the first lesson in every
school should be devoted to France: to its present
danger and its heroic resistance; to the ideals of
humanity and justice for which she fought; to the
memory of the valor of her soldiers; to the justice
of her cause. He desired to make certain at the
earliest possible moment that every school child
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
in France take his part spiritually and intellectually
in the epic conflict which France was waging for
right and justice.</p>

<p>His decree outlining the first lesson for every
child of France expresses so clearly the French
attitude and feeling that the following free rendering
of the circular letter is well worth reading.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The <i>lycées</i>, colleges, and public schools are about to
open everywhere except where the superior need of improvised
hospitals in school buildings caring for our glorious
wounded renders this impossible.</p>

<p>I decree that on the opening day in every city and in
every class the first words of the teacher to the pupils
shall be designed to bring the hearts of the pupils into
accord with the sacred struggle in which our armies are
engaged.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire country at the same hour the sons
of France shall pay respect to the spirit of their nation and
shall pay tribute to the heroism of those who are pouring
out their blood for liberty, justice, and human right.</p>

<p>The words of the teachers on this occasion should be
simple and to the point. They should be adapted to the
age of their hearers, some of whom are children, some
youths. Each of our schools has sent its quota of combatants
to the firing line,&mdash;professors, teachers, or pupils; the
words of the teacher to the class should call forth the
noble remembrance of the dead, in order to exalt their
example and engrave it forever in the memory of the children.
Moreover, in its broad lines, calmly, clearly, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
should tell the causes of the war,&mdash;the aggression without
excuse,&mdash;and how before the civilized world, France, eternal
champion of progress and right, has been compelled to
prepare herself, with her valiant allies, to repel the assault
of the modern barbarians.</p>

<p>The furious conflict which we are carrying insistently to
victory adds each day to the glory of our soldiers a thousand
deeds of heroism from which the teacher may take the
best part of this lesson. He should prefer these supreme
models of action to the vain repetition of phrases, in order
to make a fit impression on the minds of the children.</p>

<p>A vivid recollection of this first school hour ought to
remain imprinted forever in the spirit of the pupil, who
is the citizen of to-morrow. The teacher who has known
how to make this impression will remain worthy of the
confidence of the republic.</p></blockquote>

<p>America too will have its lesson sheets, and a
most timely one on "Lessons of the Great War
in the Classroom" has been prepared for teachers
of history by the National Board for Historical
Service (Washington, D.C.) with the distinct purpose
of suggesting certain aspects of history, ancient
and modern, which have gained a new interest in
the light of the great war. The following excerpts
are extremely suggestive of special opportunities
and obligations for teachers in school service:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is the duty of keeping, for teacher and for pupil,
the habit of at least trying to see things as they really were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
and are.... Every great war is fought not merely by
armies and navies, but by the governments at home which
direct the fighting forces.... No one can take an intelligent
part in a great conflict for the safety of democracy
under an orderly system of international law unless he is
really interested in and knows something about other nations
than his own.... There is some connection between the
conditions which made the valleys of the Tigris and
Euphrates one of the great seats of ancient civilization and
those which are making Mesopotamia to-day one of the
chief theaters of the great war.... This terrible catastrophe,
with its wholesale destruction of the finest products
of human civilization, its life and death struggle between
opposing nations and opposing ideals, has seemed a reason
for thinking not less but more of the great mysterious forces
which brought about the rise and decline of the ancient
empire.... Great campaigns are again carried on where
Xenophon marched with his famous Ten Thousand, where
Alexander the Great led his armies to the conquest of
the East.... The opportunity must now be seized to
study the whole of Europe and its influence on and connections
with the rest of the world.... Some account
should be given of the way in which the ruling class in
Prussia has been able to use science, modern business
methods, and social legislation in the service of the military
state.... War is the business not only of governments
but of the nation as a whole, and there are few kinds of
human activity which do not have some relation to its success
or failure.... We are fighting partly, indeed, to
defend international law on the high seas, but partly also to
make <i>the world</i>, not merely America, "safe for democracy."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>Teachers are recognized as the instructing force
of America. If they are not, who is? If the country
sorely needs clear, definite, authentic information
on the situation of the world and our own
position as a belligerent power, who is to give it
if not the teachers? It is they who must inform
and arouse. It is they who ought to participate in
a speaking campaign which should be as deep as
the danger, as wide as the country, and as high as
the patriotic spirit of the people. They should be
distributing agents for printed material which analyzes
the subject, and should be able to refer to
the best and most available authorities and to put
before pupils and the public the texts of the most
important speeches, diplomatic notes, and other
approved material to back up statements of fact.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, it is the children's convictions
which take effect not only when as children
they carry word to their parents but also
when they come out of childhood into adult life.</p>

<p>Was the boy in the New York high school right
when he said, "It is a Wall Street war"? Are our
enemies justified in charging us with the same
motives of self-interest and the abasement of other
nations which animated themselves? Are we really
at war for conquest or seizure, or for the benefit
of commerce, or for defense against aggressions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
that have not yet been made? And is it a dollar
war for bankers and ammunition makers?</p>

<p>It is to answer these and other questions that
a systematic effort to inform and arouse the American
people should be taken up and carried into
effect by public-school teachers, having in mind
that the most effective and most important work
may be done in the classroom in connection with
lessons in civics and history. To wait for textbooks
on the present European war is to wait until
it is over. To wait to put the study of the present
war into a course of study in its chronological
sequence is to wait until the next generation of
children come upon the stage. No, now is the
time for our schools to include the teaching of
the war and to discuss officially proposed peace
plans, when the street is alive with soldiers, when
the newspapers display huge headlines and the bill-boards
are covered with recruiting posters, when
magazines furnish helpful material for teachers, and
when the whole world is charged with feeling.</p>

<p>The National Security League (New York City)
has outlined a plan for public addresses and lectures,
and it has printed a little book entitled
"Wake Up, America." The following topics have
been selected from an outline furnished by this
league:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p class="hang">
Foreign military systems and international relations.</p>

<p class="hang">Spirit of the American people as shown in our history of
liberty and democracy.</p>

<p class="hang">Causes of the war between the United States and Central
Powers.</p>

<p class="hang">First two and one-half years of the war in relation to the
principles of the foreign policy of the United States.</p>

<p class="hang">Universal military training and service as now provided by
Congress.</p>

<p class="hang">Organization and work of the army and navy: selection;
supplying needs.</p>

<p class="hang">General military preparations in the country at large: materials,
transportation, and public finance.</p>

<p class="hang">Duty of the citizen in relation to obligations of all citizens
as an offset to benefits of citizenship.</p>

<p class="hang">Service outside of military and naval; as, for example, the
munition work, transportation, building of ships and
machinery, farming, etc.</p>

<p class="hang">Faithfulness of foreign-born citizens.</p>

<p class="hang">Need of efficiency and economy in local, municipal, and
state governments.</p>

<p class="hang">Description of modern warfare as defining the immediate
task of the American people in regard to organization
and action of the various services; as, for example,
men in the trenches, health protection, Red Cross, etc.</p>

<p class="hang">Accessories; for instance, patriotic music and recitations,
flag marches, and parades.</p>

<p class="hang">Illustrative material, such as maps and charts illustrating
the problems of recruiting; slides and movies; posters
in public places; exhibitions of foreign posters.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>These topics as outlined here are not sufficiently
related to the actual conflict. They are excellent
from the formal point of view, but they fail to get
at the center of living interest in the vital present
moment of history. Often when it has been asked
of the children in France: "What are you studying?"
"What are they teaching you?" the answer
has been: "The war, madam." "The war, monsieur."
And if the question was taken up with
the teacher, the answer has been:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By means of our war map on which is marked the
present position of the French and German troops, the
particular spot in the line in which the parents of our
boys and girls are fighting, we teach not only current
history, but in the most vital way geography and many
related subjects.</p>

<p>By means of our use of great contemporary political
documents, by the speeches of Viviani, Deschanel, Ribot,
and the other statesmen, by the famous orders of Joffre,
Pétain, and our military leaders, by the interpretation of
the war by our great philosophers,&mdash;we teach in the most
vital way the need of the country, the ideals of France,
and much of the history of France. By reason of the
war work instituted in every school as part of the regular
curriculum, we teach commercial geography, economics,
and many branches of science as they are actually related
to human life and experience, and not in the abstract
manner in which they are treated in the textbooks.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>Mr. Albert Sarraut, Minister of Public Instruction
in France in 1914-1915, said in a public address:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If there remains in the schools of France a single
teacher who has not been profoundly touched by the war
and who goes about his usual occupation of teaching in
the same way that he did prior to August 2, 1914, teaching
the same subjects in the same way, doing only the
ordinary, familiar school tasks, whose work has not been
entirely transformed and inspired by the war, we have yet
to hear of him or her, and we do not believe that
such exists.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is inevitable that many of our school subjects
will change their emphasis after the war. To some
teachers the awakening will be cruel, to others a
blessing in the form of new opportunity.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE FIELD FOR INDUSTRIAL AND TRADE SCHOOLS</small></h2>

<p>For ten years a group of men in America have
been trying to convince Congress that we should
set up a national program of secondary vocational
education. As a precedent we have had a system
of agricultural and mechanic-arts education of
collegiate grade in existence for the last fifty
years. But we have had in the past no system of
national aid for promoting and maintaining a type
of vocational education in agriculture, mechanic
arts, and home-making, which would reach a much
larger clientele than could possibly be touched
through any land-grant college system. It has
been an up-hill fight to get Congress to see the
importance of providing vocational education for
industrial workers. Bill after bill was introduced
providing for national aid. These bills defined
vocational education as including all types of industrial,
commercial, agricultural, and home-making
schools, between the upper grammar grades and
the college, whose controlling purpose is to fit for
specific profitable employments and which receive
pupils 14 years of age and over.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>President Wilson in his second inaugural message
called the country's attention definitely to
the fact that a vocational-education bill was before
Congress and that it ought to receive favorable
consideration, not only on the grounds of educational
advantages contained in the bill, but also
on the grounds that it fitted in with a national
economic and industrial policy.</p>

<p>Perhaps the measure would have met the fate
of its predecessors if war had not been declared.
Friends of the measure feared lest discussion
incident to national preparedness should overshadow
the vocational-education bill, but fortunately
Congress saw that vocational education and
national preparedness were linked together, and
the bill passed almost unanimously.</p>

<p>The full significance of the Smith-Hughes Bill,
as it will always be known by those who worked
for it, can hardly be appreciated. On the surface
it merely creates a Federal Board of Vocational
Education and provides that federal grants shall
be made for the purpose of coöperating with the
states in the promotion of industrial, agricultural,
and home-making teaching. But if we scratch the
surface we shall see that the federal money is not
paid to local communities except after their work
has been approved by a state board of control on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
the basis of this federal act, and the principles and
policies which were adopted after conference between
the Federal Board and the state boards of
control. It furthermore limits federal aid to definite
vocational training and eliminates all aid to any
dilettante or superficial types of practical-arts education
which do not meet the idea of preparing
young persons over 14 years of age for useful and
profitable employment in agriculture, in the trades,
in industries, or in home economics. It has been
stated in preceding chapters, and will be emphasized
more than once in succeeding chapters,
that the schools which are able to serve most
effectively in time of war are the schools which
are serving or may serve in times of peace. It
has been and will again be shown that school
methods usable in meeting a war emergency are
the methods not only usable but desirable under
normal conditions.</p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing in the following
discussion of the field for war service for industrial
and trade-school education which does not
have its direct application in promoting and administering
a national system of vocational education.
Definite suggestions are given for organizing
day-industrial, trade, part-time and continuation
schools, evening vocational schools, trade classes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
and off-time courses; for transferring the teaching
equipment into the factory; for transferring the
technical-supervision equipment of the factory to
the school; and for making commercial products. It
will be seen that the service of our industrial and
trade schools differs from the service of the industrial
and household-arts courses in the regular
schools. A comparison of what is suggested for
war service with what is required by the terms
of the federal grant shows that the two are in
accord. For example, the latter requires that all-day
industrial schools must have at least half the
time given over to the actual practice of a vocation
on a useful or productive basis; that agricultural
schools shall arrange for directed or supervised
practice in agriculture either on a farm provided
by the school or on other farms for at least six
months a year; that part-time schools or classes
must be established if the state and the community
expect to receive the full benefits of the
federal grant for the salaries of teachers of the
trade, home-economics, and industrial subjects; and
finally, that evening classes for industrial workers
are provided in which the instruction is required
to be supplemental to the daily employment. However,
for the duration of the war, at least, the last
requirement needs modification.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>War preparedness undoubtedly influenced Congress
to pass the Smith-Hughes Bill. War service
of our vocational schools will undoubtedly influence
the vocational-education movement along right
lines more than anything else which could possibly
have happened.</p>

<p>Industrial and trade schools stand ready to
make their contribution for war service. Some
rather unwisely, and certainly unthinkingly, sent
telegrams to Washington, offering their equipment
to the government. Others said that they would
make ammunition. Still others announced that
they would wait for the government to tell them
what to do. In the early stages evidently most of
them forgot that their chief, if not only, business
must be, as it has been, that of training recruits
for industry or giving trade extension work to those
already in a chosen vocation.</p>

<p>Of course we are all aware that new tasks of
stupendous proportions are being undertaken by
the country as measures for national defense, and
that while a large army is being recruited and
trained, a still larger army is being drawn into
industrial production to equip and support the
army and navy directly on the lines of defense.
We know that $600,000,000 has been appropriated
for aëroplane construction; that from 50,000
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
to 100,000 shipbuilders are needed for our shipbuilding
program; that tool-makers and gauge-makers
are needed in large numbers; that the government
military service will require large numbers
of mechanics in its quartermaster's, engineering,
signal, aviation, and navy corps.</p>

<p>In other words, there is convincing evidence that
there are bound to be not only increased demands
for labor but also changes in the relationship of
labor demand and supply. There is going to be
an enormous increase in the demand for specialist
workers in metal, and considerable increase in the
call for skilled all-round workers in metal; a material
increase in the demand for woodworkers
in shipyards; an increase in demand for workers
in manufactured clothing and army equipment; a
great increase in demand for electrical workers in
all lines, including operators, field men, telephone
and telegraph service. We know that there will be
a demand for automobile mechanics, gas-engine operators,
plumbers, horseshoers, wheelwrights, steam
engineers, bakers, cement workers, and gas and
steam fitters. It is probable that there will be a
diminution in the demand for printers; for women
in dressmaking, millinery, and novelty lines; for
laborers on public works, including streets, sewers,
water systems, public buildings, canals, and bridges.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p>In short, we know that the war emergency will
create an extraordinary demand for some kinds of
labor, attended by a probable diminution of demand
for other kinds, and there will be occasion for much
shifting of labor from one occupation to another.
It is obvious, furthermore, that many readjustments
must be made by public and private industrial and
trade schools in these days of war pressure.</p>

<p>To determine what adjustments are most urgent,
those in charge of these schools should go directly
to the industries and confer as to what service is
the most desired. It is practically useless to wait
for industrial managers to come to the schools for
help. In many cases they will not appreciate the
fact that the schools can be of help. If, in times
of peace, industry has hardly recognized the full
possibilities of public vocational training, it is not
likely that it would recognize it in the stress of
increased production. Sir Robert Blair of London
states that unless the educational staff of England
had made it its business to satisfy the manufacturers
that it could train semiskilled workers,
the vocational-training shops would have been
obliged to close soon after the war started. He
states that in the earliest days of the work of
these training shops, the manufacturers were indisposed
to believe that industry had anything to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
learn from trade or technical schools. The manufacturers
said that these schools were "academically
right and practically wrong."</p>

<p>What industrial and trade schools can do for
manufacturing plants will, of course, vary in each
community. Each manufacturing center has its
own sets of activities. Proper military authorities
should be approached by administrators of industrial
schools to determine what can be contributed
toward providing the training which is needed.
Letters to military authorities in Washington will
not bear so much fruit as a personal visit to a
local recruiting station, camp, or cantonment for
definite advice as to how schools may best serve.
It is expected, however, that the National Board of
Vocational Education will be helpful with suggestive
material.</p>

<p>At the present moment the most effective contact
between the school that may give the training
and the place that needs it can be brought about
through coöperation either with cantonment authorities
or with local manufacturing plants. Industrial
and technical schools in England in the early days
of the war formed connections with government
arsenals and began the manufacture of gauges for
shell-making, mostly of the inspection type. At first
the technical institutes were very diffident about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
undertaking the work, the standard of skill required
being so high; but after a few appeals on
the ground that it was a great opportunity for
trade education to show its value, the institutions
started the work, so that there are now something
like a dozen such schools working on the manufacture
of these instruments. It is to be understood
that the majority of the workers thus employed
were metal workers before they took up this work.
Others were manual-training teachers in the elementary
schools. They have turned out approximately
50,000 inspection gauges, and it is the
opinion in England that the trade institutes never
undertook a better work.</p>

<p>In general terms the shortage of help in the
industries is going to be met by training operatives
selected from unskilled workers; by training
foremen of those operatives who will be selected
from the skilled help; and by training highly
skilled specialists who will be selected from the
workmen already skilled. The training plan in
the New England Westinghouse plant will be
interesting in this connection. In this ammunition
plant 80 per cent of the workers are listed as operators,
the majority of whom are trained from carefully
selected unskilled labor. To train these operators
skilled machinists are employed as instructors. One
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
instructor is in charge of a group averaging about
thirteen men. In other words, 7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per cent of the
force in the operating departments are on the
instruction staff and known as foremen, linemen
(set-up men), and instructors. Instruction is given
incidentally in turning out the regular product.
No equipment is set aside primarily for instruction
purposes; any equipment in the plant may be thus
used. This method of instruction is called the
group-instructor plan, in which one instructor or
foreman has charge of teaching a group of operators
working on an assigned task. While under
instruction the group is employed on regular
production. The instructor is not required to produce,
but gives his entire time to group teaching.
In the tool-making department, men of mechanical
ability, not necessarily all-round machinists, but
in some instances from other trades, are trained
in making jigs and fixtures. In these cases the
ratio of instructors to workers is less than one
to thirteen, the helper plan being used. The
helper plan is that in which a skilled worker is
employed in special work, such as tool-making or
gauge-making, and has under him from one to
three helpers. In this case the man who gives the
training does not confine his entire efforts to instruction,
but is required to work at his particular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
occupation. If satisfactory results are to be secured,
only a very limited number of helpers can be
assigned to one worker.</p>

<p>The industrial schools will prove to be a small
factor in training operatives, in view of the fact
that industry itself is able to train them quickly
and satisfactorily. It takes only a few days to
make a Polish farm hand of Connecticut into an
ammunition worker in Bridgeport. Foremen and
specialists may be trained through evening and
day part-time courses. Of course it is assumed
that these schools will have equipment requisite
for training in the kind of work for which help
is needed. The Springfield (Massachusetts) Vocational
School expects to shift some of its pupils
from house to ship carpentry in view of the new
demand for men with a knowledge of shipbuilding,&mdash;a
demand which will extend, undoubtedly, over
a term of years.</p>

<p>At least, one way for a trade school to be of
service and yet not purchase additional equipment
is to lend its skilled instructors to a local manufacturing
plant where an organized plan for training
foremen and specialists exists. This has been done
by the Quincy (Massachusetts) Industrial School,
which coöperates in furnishing part of the instruction
given in the Fore River shipbuilding plant.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
This company is giving instruction to a selected
group of workers under pay for a full industrial
day of ten hours. A night shift of training for
eleven hours is also given to another group of
men. Instructors are training an assigned group
of operators on regular production and under usual
employment conditions. Some part-time instruction
in technical subjects, and in some cases on special
operations, is also given to certain groups of selected
workers while under employment in the plant. This
plan has a significance worthy of attention after
the war.</p>

<p>General Manager Smith of this company, at a
conference of state administrators of vocational
schools held the middle of July in New York City,
made an interesting statement as to the need of
trained help in the shipyards. A summary of his
remarks follows:<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>For shipbuilding purposes men trained in the building
trades offer little advantage over intelligent untrained men,
as the character of work in the shipbuilding industry is so
different from that in the building trades.</p>

<p>However, industrial and trade schools can give preliminary
and thorough instruction to ship-fitters and loftsmen.
The course for the latter should include ship-drafting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
More limited instruction can be given in other ironworkers'
trades and in the shipwright trades.</p>

<p>Trained instructors are needed. Instructors may be employed
in the plant and, if so, should have full power to
instruct and should not be employed on production, as the
best results in instruction can only be obtained by having
the instructor concentrate his mind on his work.</p>

<p>Shipbuilding in the United States has been one of our
smaller industries. If the present crisis is to be adequately
met, the industry will be one of our most important ones.</p>

<p>Of the large amount of money to be spent in shipbuilding,
practically one half will be expended on labor in the
shipyard; the remainder is for material purchased from outside
parties, but which at the works of such subcontractors
is again largely labor. Of the labor expended in the shipyard
about one third is for ironworkers, and it is in this
trade that the greatest shortage occurs, as there is only a
small percentage of men for the ironworkers' trade now to
be found in this country.</p>

<p>In the past very little instruction in the specialized shipbuilding
trades has been given in the United States, and
the number of men who have served apprenticeship in these
trades is small, a great supply of skilled men in these trades
coming from Great Britain. There is an imperative need
for a supply of men in the ironworkers' trade.</p>

<p>Some instruction must always be given in the shipbuilding
plant, but it is possible to give a great deal in
the industrial schools, and, as the wages are good, men
should be readily attracted to the shipbuilding trades.</p>

<p>While ironworkers' trades consisting of loftsmen, ship-fitters,
riveters, chippers, calkers, reamers, bolters, packers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
and some others are peculiar to shipbuilding as well as
the shipwright's trade, the trades of plumber, pipe fitter,
coppersmith, etc. are very materially different in the shipbuilding
trades from what they are in the building trades.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, it is possible to send instructors
from the factories to the school. In several
instances in England the manufacturers supplied
the schools with instructors and all the necessary
material in order to teach women and boys the
identical operations which they would be called
upon to carry out in the factory. In this way a
number of schools combining manufacturing with
training were able to supply local factories with
boys and women trained in the special operations
involved. This plan is also significant and has
an important bearing upon the administration of
public vocational training.</p>

<p>The question whether industrial schools should
make ammunition or equipment pertaining to war
service will come up. Having substantial amounts
of available equipment, they will doubtless at times
be tempted to use their organized day and evening
classes for purposes of emergency productive work.
In machine-shop schools, for example, the teachers
being skilled machinists and the pupils capable
of turning out a substantial amount of productive
work, inducements to subordinate educational ends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
to those of an economic nature may be expected.
It is therefore suggested that industrial-school
authorities resolutely resist all attempts to subordinate
their rightful purpose of giving industrial
education. It is clear that a certain amount of
production is necessary for purposes of education,
but it is important that this should never be made a
primary purpose in any industrial school. A letter
from Director W. C. Smith of the Troy (New York)
Central School illustrates the productive work of
one school which retains educational value.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A Troy corporation is engaged on a large contract with
the government for uniforms. Its shops are taxed to the
limit, and it has found it necessary to utilize every available
shop in town for making various machines used in
cutting cloth for this contract. It has entered into an
arrangement whereby our complete machine-shop equipment
is turned over to its use under the supervision of
our own instructor. Our graduate boys are employed in the
shop and are now at work perfecting twelve machines for
use in different parts of the country on this contract.</p></blockquote>

<p>The public vocational schools must face, sooner
or later, the question of shop production on a
commercial basis. They exist, primarily, to train
producers and not to make products. Are the two
inconsistent? Perhaps the war service of these
schools will bring this debatable issue to a head.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>Obviously the industries engaged in the making
of automobiles, aëroplanes, machinery, and ammunition
have for some time past absorbed the available
supply of skilled help. With the emergency of
war preparation upon us, we must find ways of
pressing thousands of workers into lines of work
with which they are almost altogether unfamiliar.
Except with boys who are fourteen to sixteen years
old, it will be of little avail to think of giving all-round
trade training. The labor supply which we
now need must be trained immediately and intensively.
From what has already been stated it is
clear that workers may be trained in three ways:
first, in day industrial or technical schools; second,
in industrial plants such as have been mentioned
in the case of the Westinghouse Company; third,
through part-time employment in industry, with part-time
attendance in industrial or technical schools.</p>

<p>The industrial-school authorities should send into
the factories capable instructors who have had
trade experience, in order to learn the needs for
trained help and to analyze the trade processes for
which men need to be trained. In this way the
school may determine whether it can best meet the
situation by training the youth in its day schools to
go to work in industrial plants upon leaving school&mdash;although
this is not a very immediate way of meeting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
the emergency&mdash;or whether it would be better to
move the classes, so to speak, over to the plant
and have the instructors teach a group of unskilled
workers on the group-instruction plan. Perhaps
the school could perform its best service by giving
trade extension courses to those already engaged
in productive work. Anyhow, these alternatives
must be fully considered.</p>

<p>These instructors or trained experts, when visiting
typical yards or plants in a specific industry to
learn of the needs for trained help, must be able to
reanalyze the trade processes in terms of training
as distinct from terms of production, and out of this
analysis to draw up suitable schemes for giving
such training. The question of whether this training
should be given entirely in the school or entirely
in the plant or partly in the plant and partly in the
school should be left to experts, who know best the
possibilities of each of these schemes.</p>

<p>This is no time for industrial schools to stand
on their dignity and claim that they can do all
that is necessary in their day schools without
coöperation with those who employ. It is readily
granted that, generally speaking, directors of industrial
schools know their job quite well when
it comes to giving trade-preparatory training to
youth before it enters industry; but at a time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
when the country needs thousands of workmen we
are quite sure that the better plan for training
operators and semiskilled workers is directly in the
plant itself. In a time of great emergency this intensive,
immediate training must be given in large
part by the industries themselves within their own
plants. They have the equipment, they have the
men who need the training; all they lack is the
proper instructing force, as they cannot take men
away from production for instruction purposes. It
follows that the instructors of our schools must give
their instruction in the plants or must have the
unskilled operatives and helpers come to the school
for part-time work.</p>

<p>The present all-day industrial schools, even in
normal times, need this direct contact with industry
to save themselves from shop methods which savor
of manual-training schools.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the regular all-day industrial
and trade schools will continue. Of course they
are now largely attended by comparatively young
students, and it is quite likely that the enrollment
will diminish, as there is an unusual demand for
boys in every branch of industry and commerce.
It will be increasingly difficult to hold such boys in
school in the face of financial returns rather extraordinary
when one considers their youth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>In the interests of conservation of youth and the
training of a suitable supply of skilled workers for
the future, there should be no diminution of effort
to develop and extend day-school work, even though
the young people thus trained will be too young
to contribute definitely to the present emergency,
unless, of course, it should last more than a year
or two. Nevertheless, the enrollments are likely to
be less. A partial compensation for this situation
is that groups of more mature workers coming
from the industry itself on a part-time basis can be
accommodated for special instruction, or groups of
young men who are now elevator boys, messenger
boys, clerks in stores, office boys, can be induced,
perhaps, to come to the all-day school, and through
short, intensive courses be put into the way of earning,
in some factory making war supplies, a sum
equal to from two to three times what they are now
earning. No attempt should be made to hold such
youths in the school beyond the period necessary to
give them immediate and intensive training.</p>

<p>After the war it will be an open question whether
intensive courses should not be more generally
adopted in our day industrial schools.</p>

<p>Obviously the largest immediate service that can
be rendered by industrial and trade schools will be
through the readjustment and extension of evening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
and other off-time courses. As usual, the especially
important function will be the training of
men already in the trades for more skilled tasks or
for directive work. Ways must be found for extending
the evening-school facilities. One way is to
operate the evening courses throughout the entire
year. Most of our industrial schools operate only
from October to April, but in this time of pressure
they should be open continuously. The other way
would be to carry on trade extension work not only
in the evening but also early in the morning or late
in the afternoon. These are technically known as
off-time courses and came into existence originally
in some cities which made provision for training
workers from plants operating night shifts.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, even in times of peace, there
is no sound reason for ever completely closing a
day industrial school. It might run during the
summer as well as the winter; in the late afternoon
and early morning as well as in the evening.
In the middle of June, 1917, President Wilson addressed
a letter to Secretary Redfield making the
suggestion that the vocational-training schools of
the country should be open during the summer,
when it would be possible to train a large number
of young men under military age, either to fill the
places in our industries left by men who enlist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
or are withdrawn for military service, or to carry
on special occupations called for by the war, such
as inspectors of material and apparatus. In this
connection, where the President speaks of "inspectors
of material," it may be said that one of
the prominent industrial-education experts of the
East has been asked to train a group of men
selected for special government inspection work.
These men will then be responsible for organizing
a force of assistant inspectors in the plant to
which they are assigned, and of supervising the
work of the assistant inspector under their personal
direction.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The course of inspectorship training is made up of two
units: one dealing with the business and accounting side of
inspection and the other with the technical instruction which
is given through participation in the actual work of inspection
at the arsenal, observation of the manufacturing processes,
and direct group instruction.</p>

<p>The first unit is given at Washington and usually requires
from four or five days to a week for its completion. The
second unit is given at the Rock Island arsenal and covers
eleven days as a minimum. Only the most experienced men,
however, complete it in this length of time. The men enter
the school at irregular intervals in groups of four or five at
a time. The number in training at any one time varies
from thirty-five to fifty.</p>

<p>The men are moved from department to department on
a fixed schedule. When a man completes his training he is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
assigned to a plant in accordance with his qualifications as
indicated by his previous experience and his record at the
school. Further plans for training the inspector after he has
been assigned to the field have been proposed but have not
yet been put into effect. Many of the candidates for this
training are instructors in vocational training.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The opportunity for promotion of skilled workers
was never so great as at present, and the opportunity
for schools to train them will never be
greater than at present. The schools may well
organize intensive short courses in practical training,
as well as other courses designed to advance
qualified workers to positions of directive work in
the factories.</p>

<p>While the part-time plan offers excellent opportunities
for advancing selected workers in order
that they may acquire certain technical knowledge,
it is doubtful whether much of this work during
this emergency period can be done in the public or
private industrial and trade schools. We all know
that certain industrial concerns have established
part-time schools in their plants. These classes in
the works are especially adapted, in the present
emergency, for training selected workers to become
specialists and foremen. If the school is near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
the plant, so that industrial workers can attend for
part-time day instruction for a period of six or
eight hours a week without loss of time or without
interfering with production, it may be possible to
develop some part-time courses in the schools, but,
generally speaking, it would be better for the instructors
in these schools to go directly to the
plants themselves and give this part-time instruction
there. In another chapter mention will be made of
a feasible part-time system and the necessity for
some such system, but it refers only to boys and
girls between fourteen and sixteen years old who
belong primarily in school and not primarily at
work. It is assumed that the group of which we
have been thinking is the older group of workmen
who wish to become foremen.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Blair, in his report already referred
to, speaks of the manner in which technical and
trade schools in and about London train semiskilled
workers for munition work.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At first we gathered together all the metal-working apparatus
of our elementary schools and placed it in two of
our technical institutes. Shafting was put up, power was
installed and the lathes started, and they have been running
ever since July, 1915, for twelve hours a day in three
periods of four hours each. At first the period of training
was for one period a day for six days a week for six weeks,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
or a total of 144 hours, but later, to meet the demands, the
manufacturers took upon themselves the training of more
highly skilled turners, of machine erectors, of milling-machine
hands, and so on. We began to train women for
tracing in drawing offices and subsequently for mechanical
drawing. We trained lead-burners for employment in factories
making explosives. We trained gauge-makers for employment
in tool rooms of our shell factories (many of these
men have been drawn from the jewelry and silversmithing
trades). The more skill we gave the training, the longer it
took to train these people, and so the number produced
weekly has diminished, but in two years we have trained,
certified, and placed 6000 workers.</p></blockquote>

<p>And again he speaks of other training apart from
furnishing additional munition workers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One institution has done a great deal of work in training
in cold shoeing over 1000 men belonging to the Royal
Field Artillery, Royal Engineers, and the Army Service
Corps. The same institution has also been used for the
reception, inspection, and dispatch of many of the horse-shoes
required by the army. At another institution over
3500 students have been trained for Red Cross duties, and a
great work has been done in recruiting men for the skilled
sections of the Royal Flying Corps. Besides we have trained
men for tinsmithing, copper work, and wireless telegraphy.
A third institution took on the general direction of the preparation
of synthetic drugs in the chemical departments of the
technical institutes, and the medical organization of the army
was largely indebted to these chemical departments for the
production of the much-needed drugs.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>Assuming that administrators of industrial education
are interested in the welfare of factory
workers,&mdash;something often apart from instilling
technical skill and knowledge,&mdash;it will be necessary
for them to provide courses for men and
especially for women workers, giving instruction
in the laws of health with which every employee
in factory life should be familiar. In England the
memoranda of the British Health of Munition
Workers Committee have demonstrated conclusively
the great necessity of this teaching of
hygiene: that the causes of ill health of workers in
munitions factories were not alone the result of
fatigue from long hours, but quite as much the
result of insufficient or ill-prepared food, inadequate
sleep and ill-ventilated sleeping quarters, and failure
to appreciate the consequences of disregarding
safety devices.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss in this chapter to say a
word about our government naval schools, for
some may not be aware that the government has
for a number of years been maintaining a very efficient
system of trade education. The purpose
of the naval trade schools is to train young men
for various trades or occupations required on shipboard.
In going over the list it is likely that
administrators of industrial education will see an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
opportunity to connect the work of their schools
with the work of the naval schools. In addition to
the practical instruction given at the training stations
where these schools are located, a course of
academic instruction is conducted throughout the
naval service. This instruction does not stop at
the training station, but continues on shipboard,
and every encouragement is given for advancement.
Electrical schools are located at the Brooklyn Navy
Yard and at Mare Island, California. The course of
instruction comprises machine-shop work, reciprocating
steam engines, steam-turbine engines, internal-combustion
engines, magnetism and electricity,
dynamos, motors, motor generators, alternating-current
batteries, etc. Members of the radio class
are trained in the duties of a radio operator and are
given constant practice in the use of the mechanism
employed in recovering and sending messages.</p>

<p>The artificer school is located at the Norfolk
Navy Yard, and is composed of classes for shipwrights,
ship-fitters, blacksmiths, and painters.</p>

<p>The machinist and coppersmith schools are located
at Charleston, South Carolina, and are open
only to reënlisted men who have certain experience.</p>

<p>The aëronautics school is located at Pensacola,
Florida, and is divided into two courses: mechanics
of aëronautics, and flying.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>Gasoline-engine instruction is given at Charlestown
Navy Yard in connection with the machinist's
school, preference being given to reënlisted men.</p>

<p>Commissary schools for ships' cooks, bakers, and
stewards are located at San Francisco and Newport.</p>

<p>Musicians' schools are maintained at Norfolk,
at Great Lake, Illinois, and at San Francisco.</p>

<p>Seaman-gunner schools are located at the Washington
Navy Yard and at the torpedo station at
Newport.</p>

<p>All of these schools give short, intensive courses
ranging from three to eighteen months in length.
The students are paid wages, and all expenses are
met the same as with other enlisted men.</p>

<p>Seven free marine-engineering schools and thirty
free navigation schools are being started on the
Atlantic, Gulf, Pacific, and Great Lakes coasts to
train men already having some experience for better
places at advanced pay as engineers and deck
officers in the new merchant fleet. The graduates
are being placed as fast as they are graduated.
The need for their services is expected to last for
many years after peace is restored.</p>

<p>For several years our industrial continuation
schools have had as their motto "Earn and Learn."
But the naval technical schools have shown a way
whereby young men may both serve and learn.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>OUR COLLEGES AND TECHNICAL INSTITUTES</small></h2>

<p>It is to be hoped that if we can realize, as England
did not, that education, to quote Arnold Bennett,
"is the very last thing that we ought to economize
in," we shall spare ourselves some of the unnecessary
calamities of war. England, France, Italy, and the
Central Powers have thrown into battle a very large
percentage of their educated and trained men, including
most of the young professors and instructors
in their universities and colleges, gymnasiums, and
<i>lycées</i>. Their colleges and universities are almost
empty. The young men who would under normal
conditions be receiving the education and training
necessary to prepare them for leadership in the
future development of these countries are fighting
and dying in the trenches.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that all of these countries
must needs go through a long period of reconstruction,
industrial and otherwise, it is a pity that the
sacrifice of its best youth had needlessly to be made.
As a matter of fact, we see now that no university,
college, or technical school that can possibly avoid it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
should permit its faculty or student body to be
scattered or its energies dissipated. All concerned
should redouble their energies and concentrate
them upon those things which will be of the most
service in the progress of the war and will prepare
the students for the most effective service when
the war is over.</p>

<p>President Wilson, three months after the severing
of relations with Germany, in response to a request
for an opinion on the continuance of a college or a
technical-school education during the war, wrote
this letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The question which you have brought to my attention is
of the very greatest moment. It would, as you suggest,
seriously impair American prospects of success in this war
if the supply of highly trained men were unnecessarily
diminished. There will be need for a larger number of
persons expert in the various fields of applied science than
ever before. Such persons will be needed both during the
war and after its close.</p>

<p>I have therefore no hesitation in urging colleges and
technical schools to endeavor to maintain their courses as
far as possible on the usual basis. There will be many
young men from these institutions who will serve in the
armed forces of the country. Those who fall below the age
of selective conscription and who do not enlist may feel
that by pursuing their courses with earnestness and diligence
they also are preparing themselves for valuable service to
the nation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>I would particularly urge upon the young people who are
leaving our high schools that as many of them as can do so
avail themselves this year of the opportunities offered by
the colleges and technical schools, to the end that the
country may not lack an adequate supply of trained men
and women.</p></blockquote>

<p>It must be said that while students were restless
and anxious to perform a service, the college authorities
themselves adopted a very hopeless and helpless
attitude toward the war in so far as it reacted on the
internal economy of these institutions. Commencement
exercises were abbreviated and shorn of their
customary festivities. College presidents and executive
committees of alumni associations began to
"talk poor" and to wax lugubrious over the small
senior class of 1918. These men even wanted to
drop athletics, which, to the facetious layman outside,
constitutes the main reason for a college's existence.
The general action of the colleges in this matter of
abandoning so many athletic and other activities
drew from President Wilson a letter deprecating
such action and advising that the colleges maintain
all their usual sports if they did not detract in
any way from the military purpose of the nation.
In an address at Princeton University, Major
General Wood deplored hasty action of students in
enlisting for service in the army and navy, urging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
them to complete their school work for the year,
and that they mark time pending the carrying out
of provisions of the selective-draft law.</p>

<p>It is clear, on one hand, that many college authorities,
especially those of the older type, passed
through a state of academic institutional hysteria,
while, on the other hand, their student bodies translated
the emotions of the moment into a deep
conviction by enlisting.</p>

<p>At the same time the spirit of mobilization was
present in many a university, college, and technical
school. In the cultural college it was the individual
who enlisted, as the institution was not of the type
whose work directly and definitely counted for
important war service. In the universities where
courses are given in agriculture, in medicine, in
technology, and in practical arts, the institution itself
enlisted, in that it offered war-emergency courses.</p>

<p>It is perhaps interesting at this point to see how
response came from these two types of institutions.
In the first instance it came from individuals in the
college, which was no more than could be expected
of classical colleges, which have for years laid
emphasis on the benefits of individualistic training.
In the second instance the vocational colleges, as
they are sometimes disparagingly called, responded
from the viewpoint of collectivism; that is, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
college as a whole, because of its service departments,
was able to offer to the state and to the
nation a course of training of immediate military
value to the country.</p>

<p>But thoughtful people can never again speak
disparagingly of any university or technical school.
While the movies have been filled with the citizens
of our democracy, and the cafés crowded with
people to whom war was something apart from
existence, and the white-light gayety of the streets
has been apparently undimmed, the youth of our
colleges&mdash;the best youth in the world&mdash;have enlisted
in Plattsburgs, joined the Naval Reserves,
taken up signal-corps work, entered the research
laboratory, followed their instructors into the medical
corps, joined a school of aëronautics, or donned
overalls in the shipyards.</p>

<p>Doctor Finley, Commissioner of Education of
the state of New York, in an address delivered
before the Illinois chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa,
speaks of his visit to Oxford just before the war
and of a visit to Cambridge, England, a few weeks
after it had begun. At Oxford he found the calm
of the cloister, with its memorials of poets, scholars,
statesmen, princes, and soldiers, where there were
ancient academic conventions that paid no heed
to the passing customs of the world outside. Only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
six weeks later at Cambridge&mdash;a Cambridge
which had a month or six weeks before been as
Oxford&mdash;the town was filled with men in khaki.
In this charming address Doctor Finley speaks
of a portrait of Samuel Butler which he saw at
Cambridge,&mdash;a portrait of the man who described
in his book "Erewhon" a land where criminals
were treated as sick, and the sick as criminals;
where there were "Colleges of Unreason," colleges
in which students were promoted for excellence in
vagueness and were plucked for insufficient trust
in printed matter, colleges where the principal
courses were those in hypothetics, colleges in
which mediocrity was fostered, colleges whose
graduates almost invariably suffered from atrophy
of individual opinions. And Doctor Finley says
that as he stood before this portrait, in a hall
almost deserted, he thought of those students of
courses which Butler had called "hypothetical" and
"atrophying," who had gone forth to prove the
valor of their cloistered and unpractical learning.</p>

<p>The university which apparently had paid no
heed to the passing customs of the world outside
had now mobilized herself; and this has been true
of the colleges and technical schools of our own
country,&mdash;truly a mobilization of the spirit of sudden
forgetting of self-concerns for a selfless service.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>The college of individualism, as has already
been suggested, mobilized through its individuals,
while the college of service mobilized itself. In
the spring of 1917 I happened to be in a Western
university. The campus was practically deserted.
Instructors in foreign languages had joined
the government interpreters' service; some of the
professors of science had gone to government research
laboratories, while a chosen few were off
in some secret place working under government
direction in scientific research concerning submarine
warfare. The older students had enlisted, and
the younger ones were marching in squads on
the athletic field. Truly a mobilization, but largely
individualistic.</p>

<p>I came East to another college where more
than 2000 students were devoting their time to
a series of special short courses dealing with the
various problems of an educational, social, and
practical nature which the war had thrust upon the
country. In this way the institution&mdash;Teachers
College, Columbia University&mdash;had mobilized itself.
Special arrangements had been made by the college
authorities whereby all but a very few students
could participate in these emergency courses without
seriously deranging their regular courses.</p>

<p>In general, the aim of these emergency courses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
was not merely to meet those conditions which
exist at or near the battle line but to help in the
solution of the hundred and one urgent problems
which must be solved by that great majority of
teachers and social workers whose service will
of necessity be given in home communities. Accordingly,
courses on social relief were offered, and
among others the following topics were considered:
"Administration of relief in time of war and emergency,"
"Care of orphaned and neglected children."
Under the organization of rural communities were
discussed "Conserving the food supply," "The
health problem of the rural community," and "The
organization of school pupils for agricultural service."
The matter of social service in military
camps was thoroughly gone into and reports and lectures
were given by men who had actually worked
with the soldiers themselves. The Boy Scout and
Camp Fire Girl movements were also discussed in
special courses, and the practical questions of the
amateur gardener were carefully considered.</p>

<p>In the School of Practical Arts special attention
was given to the making of children's garments,
the sewing of Red Cross material, and the renovating
of millinery and clothing. In addition to
lectures on thrift in food the department of cookery
gave a course on emergency cookery for men,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
which was especially designed for army cooks and
Boy Scout leaders. There was also a series of lectures
and demonstrations by a government expert
on the preservation of food, including canning and
drying. Other courses considered the essentials of
diet planning and of how to buy in large quantities
for camps and hospitals. The departments of chemistry
and biology gave special instruction in the
analysis of water and of milk, and in the technique
of diagnostic bacteriology. The fine-arts
department made some rather unique contributions,
including a study of protective coloring with
reference to <i>camouflage</i> for military purposes, the
designing of posters, and topographical sketching.
There was a course on tin-can work for home
and camp, in which, from discarded tomato cans
and powder boxes, were produced all sorts of
useful things&mdash;coffee pots, camp stoves, hot-water
bottles, lanterns, and candlesticks. A special course
in photography for hospital and field work was
offered. In the modeling class the manipulation of
plaster of Paris was demonstrated for nurses and
Red Cross students, to be used in connection with
occupational work for convalescent soldiers. An
extremely interesting series of projects in plastic
material was worked up, particularly some clay
models of trenches and dugouts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<p>Another course which attracted some hundred
and fifty students was the emergency instruction
given by the physics department in automobile
mechanics. The object of the instruction was to
equip the average student with a stock of general
information that would enable him to operate a
car, to make minor repairs, and to diagnose
trouble intelligently. Some of the matters discussed
were the four-cycle engine, carburetion,
transmission and differential, and the storage
battery. For experiment and demonstration purposes
the laboratory was supplied, among other
apparatus, with a detachable boat motor and two
automobiles. The latter were thoroughly dissected
and then reassembled from spark plug to tires, and
in every possible way the mechanism was examined
and experimented with.</p>

<p>The departments of nursing and health and of
physical education offered some ten courses in
all, including home nursing and emergencies, surgical
dressings, care of children, public-health problems,
first aid, medical gymnastics, and invalid
occupations.</p>

<p>The department of music offered three courses
designed especially to prepare students to lead
music appropriate to patriotic meetings and to
present selections at hospitals and camps.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>Two courses were offered by the department
of speech: one planned for those intending to do
emergency speaking and lecturing, and the other
arranged to meet the demand for entertainment
for little children, the sick, and soldiers during
the war.</p>

<p>In addition to these technical courses there was
a series of lectures on economic problems contributed
by various Columbia experts, and another
series of special lectures by such speakers as
Mr. Joseph McCabe, the noted English author,
and Mr. Frederick C. Wolcott, director of the
Polish War Relief Commission. Finally, there
was a wonderful and never-to-be-forgotten address
by Ignace Paderewski, in which he reviewed the
long and troubled story of his native land and in
impassioned words pleaded for the restoration of
Poland's ancient liberties.</p>

<p>It may be said without exaggeration that in all
some millions of people throughout the United
States will, directly and indirectly, profit by this
emergency instruction at Teachers College, for the
students who attended are for the most part experienced
teachers, who, in their turn, will organize
and instruct their home communities in similar
preparedness courses.</p>

<p>At the same time another university, unique in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
its way,&mdash;the University of the State of New
York,&mdash;was holding, through its Board of Regents,
a meeting to determine academic standards of the
schools and colleges of the state in a war crisis.
This university was modeled upon the University
of France, the constituent units of which have
proved themselves wonderful instruments in the
waging of war. The universities represented have
organized themselves into a civil army, preventing
the wastes of duplication, misdirected endeavor,
and isolation so common everywhere.</p>

<p>In the building where the Board of Regents met,
two conferences were being held, one representing
the schools and colleges of the state, the other representing
the agricultural and industrial interests.
In one place men were discussing how the academic
status of professional schools and colleges
might be maintained, and in another room men
and women were participating in a discussion of
public markets, food conservation, services of agricultural
teachers, the taking of an agricultural census,
the releasing of boys from school, the organizing
of canning clubs, and all those affairs of the state
and its schools which might contribute to the
nation's welfare. These two meetings offered a
picture of two lines of work which must always
go together in time of war.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>As Commissioner Claxton has said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Students should be made to understand that it is their
duty to give to their country and to the world the best and
fullest possible measure of service, for both country and
world will need more than they will get of that high type
of service which only men and women of the best education
and training can give. Patriotism and desire to serve
humanity may require of these young men and women
the exercise of that very high type of self-restraint which
will keep them to their tasks of preparation until the time
comes when they can render service which cannot be rendered
by others.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, these same colleges and
schools must contribute out of themselves that
important vocational service so necessary in time
of war, and the gathering at this meeting of agricultural
and household-arts teachers, of farm-bureau
men and county agents, of representatives from
granges and women's clubs, of bankers, and of
publicists was after all typical of the other half of
the university or school contribution.</p>

<p>At this meeting of the Regents the following
resolutions were adopted on the recommendation
of the administrators of schools and colleges who
were in conference with the Regents. These resolutions
are given in full because they express significantly
the point of view of the 36 colleges and
964 secondary schools in New York State.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Realizing that one of the most urgent needs of the
country in the present crisis will be the training of officers
for military service, and that it is the peculiar duty of colleges
and universities to contribute in supplying this need, we
recommend that the several colleges and universities in the
state establish one or more units of the Reserve Officers
Training Corps, as provided in general order No. 49, including
courses leading at the same time to a commission
and to a college degree.</p>

<p>2. In order that the extraordinary burdens and sacrifices
of war may be shared in just proportion by all the nation,
and that the calamitous experiences of the past under the
voluntary system may be avoided, it is our judgment that
in the raising of the necessary military forces the principle
of universal obligation to service be applied by a process of
selective conscription.</p>

<p>3. That members in good standing of the graduating
classes of the professional schools of the state who shall
have been accepted for military service by the government
be granted their degrees without special examination.</p>

<p>4. That members in good standing of the graduating
classes in the undergraduate departments of the colleges
and universities of the state who would normally be graduated
in June, 1917, and who shall be accepted for military
service by the government should be granted their degrees
without special examination.</p>

<p>5. That members of the graduating classes in the high
schools of the state who would normally be graduated in June,
1917, and who have been accepted for military service shall
be granted their diplomas, and that the colleges of the state be
requested to honor these diplomas for purposes of admission.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>6. That college students in good standing pursuing
medical preparatory courses who enlist or are called into
military service before the completion of the college year be
granted certificates of completion of their year without
examination.</p>

<p>7. That absence from college or high school by reason
of enlistment in military service shall not prejudice the
award or the retention of university scholarships.</p>

<p>8. That while the immediate service which women may
perform in connection with the war will be in medicine or
nursing and other work for general public welfare, and that
while the greatest service for which they may eventually
be called will be the supplying of positions vacated by the
enlisted men, we recommend to the United States government
the appointment by the Council for National Defense
of a commission which shall outline an appropriate policy
for women students in our colleges, with respect both to
their college studies and to their enlistment for national
service.</p>

<p>9. That this board approve the plans of the National
Research Council and proffer our hearty coöperation.</p>

<p>10. That students in colleges and universities of the
state who are liable for military training under the military-training
law be exempt from the training prescribed by the
Military Training Commission if they pursue courses in military
training under approved instruction at their respective
institutions.</p>

<p>Further, that as there are numerous resources in both
the elementary and the secondary schools of the state which
can be used to advantage at this time,&mdash;among the most
important of which resources are the use of high-school
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
pupils for the farms and for necessary clerical and other
work that can be done by pupils who remain in school, the
use of teachers for summer work, the services possible
through industrial and household-arts departments, and the
enlistment of upper-grade children for home gardens,&mdash;the
board adopts the following resolutions:</p>

<p>1. That the State Agricultural Department in conjunction
with the State Education Department formulate a plan
for enlisting and placing high-school boys upon the farms,
for directing and supervising the work of such boys, for
determining qualifications as to age and fitness, for determining
compensation and school credit, and for the adjustment
of any other problems connected with the safeguarding
of these boys who enlist for farm service.</p>

<p>2. That the State Education Department secure through
the necessary sources a statement of the needs that might
be met through the industrial and household-arts departments
and other resources of the schools herein stated, and
transmit such a statement to the schools of the state, to
the end that these resources may be used intelligently and
through regularly constituted channels.</p>

<p>3. That the State Education Department consider the
practicability of securing some provision by which during the
summer vacation and at other times of the year boys 12 years
of age or over may be employed if a certificate of proper
working conditions can be furnished.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is impracticable to outline even briefly all that
the various colleges and institutes have contributed
to war service. The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is hardly mentioned in what follows,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
and yet it is conducting a score of activities of
immediate emergency value. Drexel Institute has
contributed not only courses but also its president,
Doctor Godfrey, who is serving as a member of
the National Council of Defense in special charge
of war needs as met by education and science.</p>

<p>To name all the institutions which are serving in
one way or another is to call the roll of nearly every
college and technical institution in the country.
To give here a brief account of what a few are doing
will show the range of the activities and the nature
of the service.</p>

<p>Early in May Columbia University inaugurated
a series of emergency courses of a military, naval,
and general nature arranged for the purpose of
training students who desire to serve the national
government in time of war. They were classified
as intensive courses and were opened without
restriction to all those who desired to be trained in
any of the various subjects offered. These courses
included military map making, field-service regulations,
general telegraphy, radio telegraphy, camp
sanitation, map reading and map interpretation, practical
navigation, and electrical devices of the navy.</p>

<p>Harvard University has many achievements to her
credit, for example: advanced training for selected
officers under the leadership of six French officers;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
a cadet school for ensigns; a naval school for wireless
operators; a course in orthopedic surgery;
the furnishing of the medical personnel for four
base hospital units; and war service by departments
of dentistry, medicine, psychology, and foreign
languages.</p>

<p>Iowa State College gave a six weeks' course
in special military and military-engineering work.
Regular two-year noncollegiate courses were offered
electrical workers and stationary engineers, mechanical
draftsmen and mechanics, structural draftsmen
and building superintendents, surveyors and
road makers.</p>

<p>At Cornell University all professors and instructors
in the marine-engineering department and all
the senior students of marine engineering were
in either private or public shipyards on or before
graduation day.</p>

<p>The University of Wisconsin, anticipating that
a large number of persons who had been trained in
the administration of stores would soon be needed
in the civil section of the Quartermaster's Department,
in the Ordnance Bureau of the War Department,
and in the Quartermaster's Officers' Reserve
Corps, decided to aid in training for these services
by offering special courses in the classification
and handling of stores for those departments.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>This university also planned a summer session
with courses in wireless telegraphy, first aid to the
injured, Boy Scout movement in theory and practice,
and gave a course of war lectures especially
designed for teachers, and a course for Red Cross
volunteers who wished to take part in civilian relief
work. This last course was in coöperation with the
Red Cross organization, which, as explained in another
chapter, will have much to do with relieving
families deprived of their natural heads. The men
and women in this course studied the basis of
family life, psychological and economic principles
underlying bodily health, the resources of the state
to preserve the family group, and methods of social
service and friendly visiting.</p>

<p>Aviation schools for training candidates for the
aviation corps were established at the University
of California, Cornell University, Georgia Institute
of Technology, University of Illinois, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Ohio State University,
Princeton, and the University of Texas. The first
navy aëronautic school has also been established recently
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>The College of the City of New York offered
an emergency war course in bookkeeping and office
practice to help fit men and women to fill the
positions made necessary by the increased work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
of the national government, and to train people
to take the places of those who responded to the
call to arms. It also offered its regular winter
courses during the summer in order to speed up the
graduation of young men already enrolled in the
college who might be drafted.</p>

<p>This college also placed in every armory and
military headquarters in Greater New York a
teacher of conversational French. This work was
very popular and highly successful.</p>

<p>The University of Kentucky offered to women
and civilians two special courses in its College of
Electrical Engineering: a course in automobile engineering
especially designed to teach women how
to drive and take care of motor ambulances, and
a course in wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania State College offered a six
weeks' course in storekeeping under the direction
of the Quartermaster's Department.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, through the extension department
of the State Board of Education, lessons
were given in conversational French in the armories
and encampments. In one armory as many as
five instructors were engaged in this service. The
vocabulary of the soldier being quite unlike the
French dictionary, the military terms and expressions
actually used were emphasized. Necessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
French slang and words used commonly for distances,
rations, arms and equipment, money, measures,
and military orders were dwelt upon. Spoken
French for doctors and nurses who are going to
the front has been given in coöperation with the
Metropolitan Chapter of the American Red Cross.</p>

<p>A six months' course in wireless telegraphy for
women was offered at Hunter College, New York
City, the course of training being in three divisions:
laboratory work, technical work, and the use of code.
This course was given with the expectation not
that women wireless operators will be placed on
ships of war or on transports, but rather that they
will be placed in land stations and on coastwise
steamers, thus releasing men for more active service.
It is understood that on the mechanical side
the work is harder for the women, but that on the
code work they are much quicker than men.</p>

<p>The field for service of a college is not necessarily
limited to extending the usefulness of its
vocational departments to meet the war-emergency
demands. As has already been noted, the department
of French may give courses in conversational
French in armories and in cantonments. Sir Robert
Blair writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We had this plan in England, and as volunteering grew
to very considerable dimensions towards the close of 1914
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
and there were tens of thousands of soldiers grouped within
the near neighborhood of London, an arrangement was made
with the war-office authorities for the teaching of French.</p></blockquote>

<p>Courses in mathematics applicable to war needs
may be given. The college may send tutors to
cantonments to give instruction to undergraduates
who have not completed their college work and
who would like to receive a college diploma. Colleges
can coöperate with the Y.M.C.A., to which
has been given the privilege of looking after the
recreational features in cantonments. American
college boys and others will not be satisfied with
formal military training. They will want health
talks, entertaining and educational lectures, and
instruction as to many things helpful in civil as
well as in military life.</p>

<p>There is a large opportunity, in a field as yet
hardly touched, for departments of psychology in
universities to help in selecting men for different
branches of war service and to give vocational
guidance to men who leave the service unfitted by
war work to reënter their former occupations and
perhaps untrained to enter a new service. A staff
of psychologists is now at work in each of our
cantonments applying intelligence ratings.</p>

<p>There are two distinct uses for the ratings which
are given the men as a result of the psychological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
examinations. One of these uses is military and
consists in furnishing a commanding officer with
the rating of each man in his command, by which
he may, if he chooses, be guided in selecting men
for promotion, or for special duties requiring more
than average intelligence and mental quickness.
The other use is medical and is the thing specifically
sought&mdash;to find men who are so markedly
below the average in intelligence as to demand
consideration for discharge or for assignment to
simple manual work under careful supervision.</p>

<p>The general method of the test is as follows:
The men of each company are divided into 4
groups of 75 to 80 each. Each group is first given
a simple literacy test which takes about five minutes
and shows only which of the men can read and
write. The illiterates are withdrawn at this point to
be given examinations for manual skill. All those
who can read are then given the "group-intelligence
examination."</p>

<p>Those who do not get good ratings are now re-examined
in a group to discover whether they are
merely slow or are of low-grade intelligence. If
any fail to make a satisfactory showing, they are
grouped with the illiterates who were separated
from the rest of the group after the preliminary
examination.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>All these&mdash;illiterates, and literates who have not
done well in the group examination&mdash;are given
tests for manual skill and ingenuity. These tests
are such as putting together dissembled mechanisms,
etc. After further individual examination
those who receive the poorest rating are likely to
be considered for discharge or as suited only for
manual work under supervision.</p>

<p>Those who display special mental or manual
ability are brought to the notice of their company
commanders as men who may be given assignments
for superior intelligence or skill.</p>

<p>The aims of the entire psychological examination
are to measure native intelligence and ability,
not schooling; to disclose what a man can do with
his head and hands, not what he has learned from
books; and to help the medical officers quickly to
discover and sift out the extremely incompetent,
and thus prevent the inefficiency and injustice resulting
from putting men in places which they are
not qualified to fill.</p>

<p>Of course there is a tremendous opportunity for
the college to help people understand the causes of
war. This has already been referred to in the chapter
on "War and Community Uses of our Schools."</p>

<p>Colleges having teacher-training departments will
have the opportunity of giving short courses to men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
and women who will take the places of those who
have gone to war. There is also a field for great
service in discovering ways and means of improving
our public-school systems through lessons drawn
from the war.</p>

<p>Every college and university has a large library,
and this should be examined with a view to discovering
its possible contribution to national defense
in war time. Aside from their functions of
supplying fresh news and judgments of current
events, libraries surely have a vital part in that
work of organized research which is behind Germany's
scientific and industrial efficiency. Successful
research rests as much upon adequate and
well-organized book resources as upon laboratories
and trained men. The plain and immediate duty
of a college situated near a cantonment, or having
a portion of its student body enlisted in a camp,
would seem to be to build up a military library
adequate as a center of military information for
those who are studying new methods and instruments
of attack and defense. Such a library
would be a technical library assisting the large
number of specialized schools and fields of training
for officers and men in every branch of the
service and even in different duties in the same
branch. Medical libraries of colleges should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
available, with new and important material on military
hygiene, medicine, sanitation, and surgery, and
this material should be given the widest publicity
with reference to its usefulness for the military,
medical, and hospital corps.</p>

<p>The college library might well lend to a cantonment
a member of its library staff for the development
of not only a technical library but also a
general reading library for those soldiers who desire
only general reading.</p>

<p>The geological department of a college can help
in deciding on foundation conditions for army-work
constructions, on the location of camp sites
with reference to topography, drainage, and water
supply, and on the location of trenches with reference
to dryness, underdrainage, and rock deposits.
Such a department can participate in the study of
earth vibrations in connection with heavy artillery
discharges for the accurate determination of the
distances of enemy batteries. It can also help the
government in giving more exact training to young
men in the interpretation of geological and topographical
maps.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the technical college and the
technical institute may render the greatest government
service through its faculty and student body.
Armour Institute of Chicago has a large number
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
of its graduates and older students in concerns
which are producing munition supplies and war-ships.
Many have entered the signal service, and
a large class in marine engineering has been specifically
organized to prepare men for service with
the government.</p>

<p>Wentworth Institute in Boston, under the direction
of Principal Arthur L. Williston, has been
giving instruction in various branches of military
engineering to the First Regiment of Engineers
of the Fifth District, U. S. A. This regiment was
originally an infantry regiment, but the men voluntarily
elected to train themselves to become an
engineering regiment. The commissioned officers
and non-commissioned officers and all the enlisted
men gave three nights a week to the work for
several months. In addition some sixty of the men
in the regiment voluntarily resigned from business
positions in order to devote eight to ten hours a
day, six days in the week, to the work. This institute
instilled what Mr. Williston calls "mechanical
gumption" into the enlisted men through short
unit courses in mapping and surveying, topographical
sketching, and map reading; gasoline-engine
operation, repairing, and maintenance; portable
steam-power plant construction and operation;
electrical-power plant operation; field telephony;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
electric-line construction and maintenance; timber
construction, including pontoons, timber trusses, timber
suspension-bridge construction, machine-gun
shelters, dugouts, and dugout tunneling and framing;
strength of materials; concrete construction,
including culverts, bridge abutments, gun-carriage
and engine foundations; acetylene welding and
demolition work; thermite welding and emergency
repair; machinery erection and alignment; forging,
hardening, and tempering; hydraulics and drainage,
especially trench drainage; and rigging. The time
was too short to give any elaborate theoretical
training. The instruction was given through brief
and intensive courses in a very practical way. In
many instances it showed men who had practical
experience and ability how to adapt their particular
kind of skill to the special needs of the given
service. Many of these men already had skill, but
they needed to have it adapted to military ends.</p>

<p>Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York, has been
conducting 8 evening classes in machine-shop practice,
6 classes in machine-drafting design, 1 evening
class in elementary ship drafting, and day courses
for a large body of enlisted men from the navy
electrical school and from the signal reserve corps.
Those who come from the signal reserve corps are
being trained for active service in telegraphy, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
institute furnishing the technical instruction in elementary
and applied electricity, and army officers
furnishing the military and field-service instruction.
A mess for the men of this corps is conducted at
the school of household science connected with
the institute, and here details of men are trained
for this work through a course in army cooking.
The men from the electrical school are quartered
at the navy yard, and spend five and one-half
hours a day at the institute taking courses in
machine-shop operation, steam-engine practice, elementary
electricity, armature- and field-coil repair
work on electrical machines, elementary chemistry,
and batteries. It is interesting to note that Pratt
Institute made a special effort to hold intact its
student body of the regular courses, on the theory
that the thoroughly trained mechanic or technician
in service is many times more valuable to the
nation than a private in the ranks. As a result of
this effort, very few of the students of the day
school dropped from the regular courses.</p>

<p>The William Hood Dunwoody Institute of Minneapolis
began immediately on the severance of
relations with Germany to serve as a recruiting
station for the United States Engineers' Enlisted
Reserve Corps, the United States Signal Enlisted
Reserve Corps, the United States Quartermaster's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
Enlisted Reserve Corps, the United States Civil
Service Commission, and the United States Navy.</p>

<p>It also outlined a scheme for taking a census of
mechanics and technicians for the state of Minnesota,
which is now being carried out, and on the
basis of which recruiting will go forward for every
branch of the government service.</p>

<p>It made arrangements for bringing to Minneapolis,
on the first of August, 425 recruits from
the Great Lakes Naval Training Station at Chicago,
and distributed them among the following
classes in training at the institute: general electricians,
radio electricians, carpenter's mates, machine-shop
operators, gas-engine operators, blacksmiths,
coppersmiths, cooks, and bakers.</p>

<p>The institute is training more than 200 novices
in day and evening classes in telegraphy. Of these
about 60 per cent are girls and women, this course
being offered in response to a direct request from
railroad and telegraph lines in the vicinity of Minneapolis.
It is also giving some instruction in
operating-foremanship work for a prominent local
steel and machinery company, as this company has
renewed the manufacture of munitions and needs
operation foremen. The institute was called upon to
select the most promising men and to train them in
one process of which they are later to have charge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
in the shop. Director Charles A. Prosser in making
a report to the secretary of the National Society
for the Promotion of Industrial Education said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We have 154 people taking radio work in day and evening
classes. This group is made up of a number of different
types. First, there are the amateurs with licenses who have
enlisted in our first radio company of the United States
Signal Service and have gone into that class to improve
their speed. Second, there are other young men who have
gone in to learn the work so as to be recruited into another
radio company of the United States Signal Corps or into
the naval service, and there are, in the third place, young
men who have gone in with the idea of offering their services
to the Marconi Company, either for land work or for
duty on board the merchant ships which are being built.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 mechanics and
technicians have been sent into different branches of the
government service by Dunwoody Institute. This number
is made up in part of our own students from our school&mdash;particularly
from the evening classes, although some of our
day boys have gone&mdash;and in part of mechanics and technicians
throughout Minnesota who have gone into the service
through Dunwoody Institute, where we conduct a recruiting
station and where we are recruiting into the service every
Wednesday, applications being taken in the interim.</p>

<p>We have sent into the service 1 motor-truck company;
2 others are in process of organization. We are sending out
1 radio company, which is ready to go, and are about to
organize another. We are also organizing 1 wire company,
1 baking company, and 1 company of cooks. In addition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
we have sent men to the Brooklyn Navy Yard and are sending
men to the Puget Sound Navy Yard. We have also
put men in touch with the Civil Service Commission and
sent them into the service in this way.</p></blockquote>

<p>The response of these and other colleges and
technical institutes justifies as nothing else could
their past claims that they train not only for the
spirit of service but for the life of service.</p>

<p>The effect of the war on the college curriculum
cannot be hastily measured. Institutions of collegiate
grade are slow to make radical changes in
the requirements for the bachelor's degree. Some
have already shortened the college course to three
years. Others have decided as a war measure that
students ought to be through college by the time
they reach conscription age. Some are offering
opportunity for all-the-year-round work. Others
are allowing war service to count toward a college
degree. The English universities are already
thinking of strengthening their courses in science
and laboratory research, of giving more attention
to modern languages, and of developing vocational
courses.</p>

<p>Certainly in America there will be an immediate
and greater demand for so-called "practical" subjects.
It may be that one of the effects of the war will
be the sharpening of the differentiation and an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
increase of competition between the idealistic and
the practical groups of studies. This will be unfortunate.
There should be no sharpening of differences
of opinion. They had much better be
dulled. There is no real necessity for antagonism
between the cultural and the vocational subjects.
People only <i>think</i> there is a need for constant
justification of the one against the other. Such
thinking has become a habit of mind.</p>

<p>The French have a way of saying that the cultural
subjects are merely the moral conditions, the
ethical history, and a judgment as to the ethical
value of the world complex of vocational and economic
life; for this reason any conflict between cultural
and vocational subjects is impossible, and the
more vocational education is developed, the more
will the cultural aspects be needed and the more
highly developed will they become. The French
point out that what we term cultural subjects
developed in two civilizations which were very
highly practical, vocational, and militaristic; namely,
Greece and Rome. They speak of the humanities
as being essentially the abiding lessons of those
civilizations which in vocational and military efficiency
stood much higher above their fellows
than Germany stands in those respects above
contemporary civilization to-day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>Vocational subjects are direct-service subjects
always. By their very nature they respond immediately
to an emergency. The cultural subjects
are more indirect in their effect. They could not
be otherwise. I often wish we could get into the
habit of speaking of liberal subjects in the sense in
which this term was used in the older days of our
colleges, when the term "liberal" implied that the
subjects classed under this head were liberalizing;
that is, they liberated, or set free, the minds, spirits,
and bodies of men and women from prejudice,
selfishness, tradition, passion, cruelty, and so on.
I have never seen how one could <i>elect</i> culture,
for it is always a by-product coming out of thinking
and living. To study the language of an
ancient people and to learn nothing of their government
or ideals is useless. To study this government
and these ideals of an older civilization
and to see no lessons for the world of to-day is
almost valueless. To study the past in terms of
problems of human society is liberalizing.</p>

<p>New meanings of the realities of war are before
us. New concepts of two great ideals of government
confront us. New methods of making war
more horrible strike our eyes with every news
issue. New schemes for patching up human life
that it may go forth again to battle or return to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
industrial warfares of peace are heralded every
week. New societies for the relief of human suffering
due to the war are chartered constantly.
New alignments of political groups committed to
reform are in the making. New groupings of
nations not formerly allied stand before our eyes.
New methods of combining activities of great
corporate interests for government needs are published
daily. New trade possibilities now latent are
prophesied as being inevitable. New ideals and
new ideas gathered in the trenches are appearing
over battle lines for new governmental practices.
New advances in the field of government control
of prices startle us continually.</p>

<p>Out of it all there looms up a new science of
chemistry, improved methods of transportation in
the air, a still greater standardization of making industrial
products, a new conception of government
control of trade and industry, a system of government
insurance for individuals and corporations,
new concepts of legislative authority and action,
and a score of other things all heading up into a
new sense of nationalism,&mdash;and who knows but
even a sense of internationalism!</p>

<p>Is it credible that education alone will remain
unaffected by these world changes?

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MANUAL AND HOUSEHOLD ARTS</small></h2>

<p>A new spirit of teaching practical arts is upon
us. The aims, materials, and methods of instruction
in manual training, cooking, sewing, agriculture,
and commercial branches are changing. They
have been influenced by the vocational-education
movement, and because of it practical arts in general
education must justify themselves or else be
put into the scrap heap.</p>

<p>The development and organization of differentiated
courses in industrial, agricultural, and household
and commercial arts adapted to junior and
senior high schools&mdash;more particularly in connection
with the education of children from 12 to
16 years of age&mdash;offers a new field of service to
teachers of these subjects who, up to now, have
been following methods unsuited either to the
needs of vocational training or to the needs of
general education. Already the set of wood and
iron models taken from the Russian system of the
early seventies has disappeared, and the sampler
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
book in sewing has passed away. The era of the
coat hanger and sleeve board in manual training
and of the set of doll's clothes and models of
undergarments is doomed, and the cooking outline
which starts out with making cocoa in September
and in the thirteenth lesson takes up the making
of an angel cake will soon meet the fate of flowerpot
holders, doll's aprons, and book agriculture.</p>

<p>But there is a great field for the practical arts
in general education,&mdash;a field which no scheme
of vocational training can possibly occupy. Each
has its place. Vocational training is fitting young
persons for profitable employment in chosen vocations.
Practical arts in general education consists
of varied lines of activity taken from the fields of
agriculture, commerce, industry, and the household
and taught in the school for the purpose of developing
capacity to deal with concrete things and
of arousing social and industrial interests in the
workaday world.</p>

<p>In the early years of the child's life practical-arts
work has a strong motor and social value.
In the middle years, say from 12 to 16, it has a
social and vocational-guidance value. The chapter
entitled "The Field for Industrial and Trade
Schools" gives a number of suggestions as to
the work which boys and, to some extent, girls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
may offer as their service contribution in time of
war. However there are fewer than 100 industrial
and trade schools in the country. The majority of
our youth are taking some practical-arts work as
a part of general education in either the elementary
or the secondary school, and surely these
young people will want to do something in this
emergency. And certainly the teachers of sewing,
manual training, cooking, and agriculture will desire
to do their part, not only because they can
be of service at this time but also for the reason
that through war-service work they will be able to
improve upon the practical-arts work and make it
conform to the new spirit. The whole spirit of the
new methods is based upon getting away from
individual models created out of the mind of a
teacher and imposed upon an unsuspecting student
body which follows a "course in models" in
about the same way that it takes a course in
arithmetic.</p>

<p>The present scheme of teaching practical arts
is based upon the project plan and not upon the
model or exercise plan. It no longer depends
upon the teacher's course of study founded on
tool exercises or logical sequence of processes.
It now comes out of a need which is as clear
to the student as it should be to the teacher.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
The progressive teacher of manual training starts
out with such a project, for example, as a garage.
This involves making a sketch, working up a bill
of materials, finding out the cost of lumber, cement,
and so on. It involves work in concrete, laying the
floor timbers, putting up the sides, laying out the
roof, setting in the window and door frames, putting
on the tarred paper or shingles or galvanized
iron, and painting and staining.</p>

<p>The progressive teacher of domestic arts no
longer thinks of catering merely to the personal
decorative sense of young girls. She no longer
has the girls spend the entire year making graduation
dresses, or dish towels, caps, and aprons. She
thinks in terms of quantity and in terms of social
service which the domestic-arts work may render.
She discovers that a hospital needs towels, aprons,
caps, and bed linen, or that the orphan asylum near
the school is sorely in need of children's garments,
and then she tells of this need to the girls in her
charge and the latter take up the problem in the
same way that the boys take up the problem of
building a garage. Each girl works in conjunction
with others for a common purpose which all
recognize as being worth while.</p>

<p>Progressive teachers of cooking are realizing that
the idea of 20 cooking units in a schoolroom,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
where little batches of 20 model biscuits are made
and where at the close of the lesson each girl has
one of these small eatables, is far behind the practice
of those manual-training teachers who are making
drawing tables, benches, and looms, or laying
concrete walks, building outdoor gymnasium apparatus,
and so on. Some of the teachers have insisted
on having a flat or tenement or entire house near
the school, where girls taking domestic science can
go to learn to make real beds that are really slept
upon, to clean bathroom bowls that are really used,
to cook meals that are really eaten by people who
pay for what they eat, to shake real rugs that become
really dirty, and to shop at stores where they
come in contact with actual commercial conditions
and at the end of a week discover that it really costs
money to run a real home. A few teachers, and in
time there will be many, desire to go still further.
They believe that home-making cannot be taught
without having some babies around, and so they
have established day nurseries in connection with
the home-making classes.</p>

<p>It is because of these things which have been
mentioned in some detail that I was glad, as
director of the Division of Agricultural and Industrial
Education of the New York State Education
Department, to send out a circular letter early in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
April, 1917, to our manual-training and household-arts
teachers, in which I stated that every teacher
of manual training, sewing, or cooking should be
thinking in terms of mobilization service, and that
any teacher of manual training who was conducting
his course of models, instead of thinking and working
in terms of food production or industrial war
service, was absolutely out of touch with the needs
of the day. I advised him to turn his shop work
over to home and community gardens, to increase
the time allowance given to manual work, and
help fill the cellar and pantry. I advised him to
give his Saturdays and afternoons after school and
even his vacation period to supervising garden
work in the community. I said, furthermore, that
any teacher of sewing who was not thinking in
terms of Red Cross, and of mending, darning, and
repairing, was as far away from the service idea
as she possibly could be. I told her that with the
increase in price of materials and with the scarcity
of dress goods there would be necessary repairing
and making over which would give her an opportunity
to do some real things. I even told her
that she might drop some of her sewing and help
the cooking teacher in organizing classes in preserving.
I told the teachers of cooking that if
they were running through their outlines with no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
reference to the food shortage of next winter and
the year after, they showed a lack of comprehension
of the meaning of their jobs. I stated
that the early summer and fall suggested lessons
in preserving, while the winter season conveyed the
idea of conserving. I asked whether they were
planning to stop their work in June, before the
canning season really began, and leave everything
idle until school should open, when the canning
season would be nearly over. I wondered what
provision had been made in the community for
using the summer service which they either had
offered or, I hoped, were about to offer.</p>

<p>A few weeks later word came from England of
how the manual-training teachers had been urged
by those in authority to do garden work. A portion
of these directions follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Surely wood and metal work have not the monopoly of
the educative value in manual operations. The harvesting
of an orchard of fruit or a field of potatoes by a class of
school children, accompanied by an enthusiastic teacher imbued
with the right ideal of his work, can be made to serve
other purposes than merely that of simple mechanical utility.
A discussion started at first hand between child and teacher
on such matters as variety and quality of produce, the destructive
fruit pests and diseases encountered, the crating,
packing, and distribution of produce, the weighing and
measuring actually performed, the calculating of the value of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
produce and of labor, and a knowledge that the coöperative
effort is in response to a call of England's need, would
provide open-air lessons in nature study, geography, arithmetic,
and civics quite as educative as any obtained in the
elaborately equipped manual-training centers.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is true, especially the phrase "a knowledge
that the coöperative effort is in response to
a call of England's need," which embraces the
socializing value of the manual-arts principles,&mdash;a
value which we often talk about and as often fail
to attain.</p>

<p>Teachers of cooking, in this food crisis now upon
us and the greater one which may come, ought to
suspend temporarily some of their work in teaching
children and turn their attention to teaching
adults. To be sure the girl of to-day will be the
mother of to-morrow, but the mother of the immediate
to-morrow is also the mother of to-day, and
the food crisis will be over, it is to be hoped, by
the time the girls in our present cooking classes
have grown into motherhood. These courses to
adults should be intensive and in short units.
The printing schools should print leaflets giving
practical and helpful recipes to be distributed to
the adults. If the women will not come to the
school, then the schools should go to the women.
By this it is meant that classes can be organized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
in churches, vacant stores, and settlements. In this
connection it may be of interest to quote from
the Leicester (England) education committee:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Arrangements have been made in connection with the
local food campaign whereby the ordinary schemes of work
at the domestic-science centers have been temporarily suspended
and special short courses in cookery instruction provided
instead. These courses have been designed primarily
as a means of instructing as many women and older girls
as possible in the method of preparing and cooking suitable
substitutes for bread and potatoes. In addition to the rooms
equipped for cookery instruction, those normally devoted to
the teaching of laundering and housewifery are being used for
this special work. The course is arranged to cover 4 lessons
given on consecutive half days to each group of attendants,
and at the conclusion of each course the women and girls
attend one evening for a review lesson including a practical
demonstration to which outsiders are invited. Leaflets have
been prepared and sent to the schools for distribution. The
children themselves write out the scale of rations as applied to
individual families and take their copies home, thus becoming
the active agents in the food campaign.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Albany, New York, the regular work in cooking
was discontinued early in June for the school
year of 1917, and a special course of 10 lessons in
food conservation was given at 4 domestic-science
centers. The course consisted of 1 lesson in the
preservation of eggs, 3 lessons on canning, 1 on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
making soap, 1 on butter substitutes, 2 on jellies
and marmalades, and 1 on the drying of a number
of agricultural products.</p>

<p>Not only may the domestic-science teacher go
to adults by the way of churches or settlements,
but she may go directly,&mdash;in the rural districts,
at least,&mdash;with demonstration kitchens mounted
on automobiles. In Lindsay County, England, for
example, a domestic-science lecturer arranged an
experimental course of lectures and demonstrations
on economical cookery, and equipped with necessary
utensils a traveling kitchen at a cost of $100.
She covered each of the larger villages in the area
selected, spending one day in each place, the morning
being given over to traveling. In the afternoon,
exhibitions of wheat-flour substitutes were
arranged and demonstrations given that were based
upon left-overs from her preceding evening's lesson.
She also gave short talks on beekeeping, horticulture,
fruit bottling, and so on. In the evening she
gave a cooking demonstration.</p>

<p>The "van" used by the women of Long Island,
New York State, consisted of a train of cars behind
a steam locomotive, from which demonstrations
were given in fruit and vegetable preserving.
The County of Nottingham, England, gave similar
demonstrations and in addition gave lectures to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
mothers on the necessity of taking unusual precautions
with reference to the health of babies at this
period. It was customary in much of the work in
England to have an agriculturist go with the
teacher and give talks on spraying, elimination of
pests, and conservation of garden products.</p>

<p>One of the greatest services that the domestic-science
teacher can render, whether she labors in
rural or in urban fields, is the organization of canning
clubs. The canning club enlists the services
of women, girls, and even boys. It can be made
as much of a social institution as corn husking and
barn raising were formerly. But the teacher must,
in most instances, move out of her domestic-science
kitchen with its little gas stoves and quart sauce-pans.
In the country district the equipment will
be the stove in the village church, with a wash
boiler, galvanized vat, washtub, or other vessel with
a well-fitting top, which can easily be transformed
into a home canner by making a false bottom with
lifting handles. In a village or small city it may
be necessary to beg, borrow, or buy the necessary
cooking utensils, and to obtain free use of a vacant
store, asking the local gas company to install, free
of charge, some gas ranges. The boys will prepare
the fruit; the women and girls will can it or dry
it, as the case may be. To dispose of the product
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
is a simple matter. It may be sold and the proceeds
divided. It may be taken to the homes and
the expense of producing shared.</p>

<p>In the city the domestic-science teacher serving
as a leader of the canning club must watch closely
the market and buy when the price is right, particularly
when there is a surplus that may otherwise
be wasted. It will be a new experience for many
domestic-science teachers. It is a rather different
proposition from canning a few baskets of strawberries,
cherries, or currants in a classroom.</p>

<p>Naturally other containers than glass jars or tumblers
will have to be used. In fact, the canning
club after one season of experimentation is likely
to resemble, with its larger and more efficient
equipment, a miniature canning factory.</p>

<p>In Berkeley, California, the children of the entire
city had a Jar Day, when they went out and collected
every discarded and undesired jar. These
were cleaned and sold and the money was turned
into a "service fund." Many jars, also, were filled
with surplus vegetable products to be used for the
poor in the winter.</p>

<p>Of course the old drying methods of grandmother's
days must be rejuvenated. Mr. Fred P.
Reagle, supervisor of manual training in Montclair,
discovered one of the old-fashioned evaporators and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
had a large number made up by the boys in his
school and passed out to neighboring communities.
Here is an old home industry which may be revived
in the home or the community.</p>

<p>Mr. Reagle, in describing his evaporator, writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I was obliged to build something which could be used
anywhere regardless of the availability of steam heat, electric
fans, or coal. Furthermore, it was necessary to construct
from common stock material and to use some stock
stove. I hit upon the idea of using a common laundry
stove which could burn either wood or coal. I made
20 frames, covered with galvanized wire, to hold the
fruit. The control of the air circulation was obtained by
means of an adjustable sliding door beneath the stove.
The heated air passes around and over the stove and
through the fresh food products, taking out the moisture
and going out through the adjustable ventilator at the top.
The evaporator has a capacity of from 5 to 8 bushels of
fruit and vegetables a day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another activity for domestic-science teachers of
more experience will be in the training of cooks
for the army, or, as the director of the School of
Practical Arts (Teachers College) believes, "in the
training of people to train cooks."</p>

<p>The following quotation from a letter written
by Sir Robert Blair of London to Superintendent
Maxwell of New York City shows what was done
in London:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the summer recess, 1915, 264 of our domestic-science
teachers volunteered part of their holidays in order to help in
the work of training 2500 soldiers to cook and to meet the
ordinary requirements in this line of the private in the field.
The War Office drew men from different units from all over
England and brought them to London in two great groups
and paid <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub> a day for the up-keep of the men. The
soldiers were billeted in the school buildings and the preparation
of their food formed the basis of the cookery instruction.
Each group was taken for a period of ten days.
The War Office was most appreciative of the work done by
these domestic-economy instructresses. The War Office did
not ask us to repeat this the following summer, although it
was repeated to some extent in other parts of England.
The War Office, however, did ask us to lend them 30 carefully
selected teachers of cooking for the purpose of visiting
army canteens and giving advice both on cooking and (what
I believe is more important) on quantities used.</p></blockquote>

<p>Still another service can be rendered by the
cooking teachers, especially in our large cities and
in our industrial villages. This service consists in
giving meals to children who are in want. Of
course at the present moment we see little need
for this work, but the pinch of poverty has come
upon England, France, and Germany, and our
own land may not always be one of plenty. When
the need arises, teachers should be prepared to
furnish lunches to the children and possibly even
breakfasts, to say nothing about suppers. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
dislocation of many ordinary trades and lines of
business, the taking from the home of the family's
means of support, the increased cost of food and
provisions, and the prevalence of sickness due to
neglect may necessitate the feeding of children in
school. In London the list of children to whom
meals were given daily increased rapidly from
something like 32,000 in July, 1914, up to 75,000
about the middle of September, 1914. Fortunately,
however, as trade and industry became better adjusted
there was a steady decline in the number
of children that were fed, so that in May, 1917,
there were only about 12,000&mdash;the children then
on the list being mainly the children of widows
who were forced to go out to work. The number
of meals provided per week in the schools of England
in July, 1915, was 200,000. In a year this
number had dropped to 120,000.</p>

<p class="center">Good posters have a great influence on civic life at any time. Now they are invaluable. War-service

<p>The drawing departments might well have their
students design posters. Those designed by American
illustrators for the first Liberty Loan were
surprisingly ineffective. Only one stood out&mdash;that
with the reproduction of the Statue of Liberty
with the accompanying symbol and direct wording.
Our enlistment posters have been crude, lacking
in psychological appeal as well as in design. It
is questionable whether recruiting is aided by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
picture showing a naval officer lounging under a
palm tree while in the distance a marine is seen
standing amid bursting shells on a battleship.
There has been and will be an opportunity for
students to design posters for Red Cross work;
for enlistment as farm cadets; for enrollment in a
home-service unit for girls, in community canning
clubs, in Boy Scout work, in school, home, and
community gardening; for patriotic meetings and
a score of other occasions. Good posters have an
almost incalculable influence on civic life at any
time. Within the last year there have been held in
many cities various competitions in poster work of
pupils with such subjects as "Red Cross," "Thrift,"
"Safety First," "Fire Prevention," "Pure Milk," and
"Liberty Loan."</p>

<p>There is plenty of work for the manual-training
teacher. Mention has already been made of garden
work, not so much in school gardens, however, as in
community gardens, for, like the canning-club work,
here is a splendid opportunity to bring adults and
children together. In a number of small cities in
the country where tillable land could be obtained,
the manual-training teachers directed a community-garden
project. The boys built the tool house;
the Boy Scouts took turns in acting as watchmen;
plots were laid out on a family or individual basis;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
seed was purchased in bulk and distributed at cost;
experts, hired by the day, plowed and harrowed the
ground; stakes marking the plots were made in the
school; and the manual-training instructors, or, as
they were termed, the garden directors, spent their
summer vacation in a useful service.</p>

<p>The manual-training teacher may help the Red
Cross chapter in packing supplies into the boxes
which his boys have made. He can be planning
the hospital furniture which he may be called
upon to make, as in France, where the boys
built furniture for improvised hospitals and installed
electric lights. He can be thinking how
he shall, if required, make hospital-bed racks,
cots, tables, and simple reclining chairs. Perhaps
he may have to supervise, as have the manual-training
teachers in England, the making of hand-grenade
bags, chaff bags, dummy cartridges for
the training of troops, or sand bags. In a single
secondary school in Bradford, England, more than
1200 articles&mdash;including splints, crutches, bed-boards
and rests, screens, rollers, trays, etc.&mdash;have been
made in the manual-training department in one
year. Perhaps in the early spring latrines can be
designed and built for the farm cadets, as was done
in the Newton (Massachusetts) school, or shacks
for troops, as was done at Plattsburg, New York,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
by the boys from the Stuyvesant High School,
New York City. The teacher may have his part
to play in giving vocational training to maimed
soldiers (see chapter on "Reëducation of the
Disabled"), as all of the instructors in manual-training
schools of the Dominion of Canada are
now doing.</p>

<p>A manual-training teacher in Nashville, Tennessee,
Mr. John M. Foster, has his boys make jigsaw
puzzles, checkerboards, and bandage winders
for the use of our soldiers in France. During the
summer of 1917 he organized a boys' auxiliary of
the Red Cross, and the group made packing cases
according to official specifications. The organization
included a shop foreman, a timekeeper, and
a stock man. Lumber and other materials were
contributed by local dealers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the manual-training instructor will coöperate
with the teacher of domestic science, as male
strength is needed, in providing comforts for the
soldiers, such as socks and mufflers made on knitting
machines, and in helping with the packing
and crating. In this connection there is another
quotation on the work of London children:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the end of the first year of the war we began to
organize efforts to provide clothing and other necessities
for Belgian and Serbian children. In a few months the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
schools were able to furnish 10,000 complete kits made
to the pattern and color and size supplied by the two
embassies. It is reported that the making of these kits
was one of the best exercises in planning, cutting, and sewing
which the schools ever undertook, and probably nothing
has done more to foster the school <i>esprit de corps</i> in the
history of municipal schools since their origin, in 1870.</p></blockquote>

<p>In France a number of schools, when the buildings
were turned into hospitals, equipped either
the entire hospital or a considerable number of
beds at their own expense and by their own work.
Hospital service was largely organized by these
schools. One school would be responsible for the
linen, another for mending, another for table service,
another for cooking, and another for sending
and receiving packages. A workroom established
by the school girls in one of these hospitals had
sent to the front in a year and a half 25,330
packages. One little village school of only 30
pupils in a short period collected 2542 eggs for
the wounded soldiers and made socks and mufflers
in addition. In another small district each of the
schools specialized in some kind of work, one
making up parcels for war prisoners, another knitting
sailors' gloves, another making clothing for
refugees, and still another providing candles for
troops in trenches.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>A small country school in the Midlands of England,
in addition to weekly contributions of vegetables
to the local hospital for wounded soldiers,
has made 26 bed cradles and a dozen crutches,
while the youngest boys have made splints.</p>

<p>A report from a northeast-coast district of England
mentions manual-training centers where bed
tables, toilet tables, bed rests, and clinical-chart
carriers are made for the local hospital. Even the
girls have made splints and bed tables. Of course
hundreds of sand bags have been made in the
schools.</p>

<p>The report closes with these significant words:
"The effect of all this work has been most remarkable.
Even districts where formerly little interest
was taken by the children seem suddenly to realize
the value of it all." This is what might have been
expected, and what we in America may expect
when we make our practical-arts work socializing,
useful, and contributory to some great cause that
the children see is worth while.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE WORK IMPULSES OF YOUTH</small></h2>

<p>Since August, 1914, there have been presented
to us new aspects of the relation of children to
industry. Up to that time the only consideration
for those who had the welfare of children at heart
was the child himself; but with the war, the welfare
of the child became tied up with the problem
of the welfare of the country and its demands for
service on the whole population. The endeavor to
adjust these two in nice balance has resulted in
experimental legislation or in action without legislation,
both of which have often been of no genuine
or lasting benefit to either interest concerned.</p>

<p>In America, in the first half of 1917, many of
our states appeared to be following the lead of
England in abrogating the compulsory-attendance
law, urging the same reason for permitting children
within school age to work in fields and factories.
Everyone is familiar with the facts presented by
farmer and industrial employer. In sections whose
activity has been stimulated by the production of
war products, such as Bridgeport, Connecticut, other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
industries and mercantile establishments have found
it impossible to run as usual owing to the presence
of munition plants, which attract an abnormal number
of workers.</p>

<p>Not only is neighborhood business affected by
the presence of war industries, but the farm shortage
is aggravated; for the supply of intermittent
labor, the kind demanded for berry picking, harvesting,
and canning, is not forthcoming when the
workers are offered steady employment in munition
and textile plants. In 1917 many small canneries
were threatened with the prospect of closing and
letting the adjacent crops spoil in the fields; hence
their call for schoolboys to assist them in cultivating
and harvesting. This resulted in an unprecedented
rush of children between 14 and 16 to
obtain employment certificates, and a clamor from
those below 14 to be allowed to leave school and
go to work.</p>

<p>With the nation and the state urging farmers
and food producers to make every exertion to
increase the food supply, legislatures must render
assistance in solving the labor-shortage problem.
It need hardly be pointed out that the farmer
cannot be expected to plant additional acres unless
he is reasonably sure that it will be possible for
him to have his acres cultivated and harvested.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>England as early as September 1, 1914, was feeling
the shortage created by the numbers of men
enlisting, and every Local Education Authority was
being besought by farmers and manufacturers to obtain
modifications of the law which, generally speaking,
held children in school up to 14 years. An
order of the Board of Education to the Local Education
Authority in Northamptonshire, answering
such a plea, stated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>While the Board of Education have no power to give
any general directions overriding the ordinary law with
regard to school attendance and the employment of
children,...a Local Education Authority is under no
obligation to take proceedings in respect of nonattendance
of a child at school if they are satisfied that there is a
reasonable excuse for nonattendance.</p></blockquote>

<p>The "reasonable excuse" was found in the overpowering
clamor of farmers and munition makers
who were suffering from lack of workers, as in
Staffordshire, where the petition sent to the Education
Authority by the bolt-and-nut manufacturers
at Darlaston stated that owing to the enlistment of
men in various branches of his Majesty's forces
and because of the fact that the firms concerned
were largely engaged on work of great urgency
for the naval and military services, "it was desirable,
in order to prevent delay in the execution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
of this work, that the school-attendance by-laws
should be relaxed for the duration of the war so
as to permit of the employment of boys over the
age of 13 years."<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>It cannot be stated too strongly that England
has realized too late the practical impossibility of
recovery for school of the children thus released,
and the dangers to the nation of allowing the
junior population to go into industry without supervision.
There will be introduced into our legislatures
in 1918 and later many bills which will
parallel English action, and the various states must
watch carefully to see that in their zealous attempts
to increase food or necessary manufactured supplies
they do not create and sanction disastrous conditions
for the health and morals of the young.</p>

<p>Now action in regard to our schools may be
of several types. First, there may be passed laws
which abrogate the existing compulsory-attendance
law; such legislation would be that permitting
children below compulsory school age to leave
school. Second, it is possible to have the existing
laws interpreted so as to excuse absence from
school, as in North Dakota, where the attorney-general
in an open letter to school officers, April,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
1917, interprets the section of the school law exempting
children from school attendance in cases
of necessity to apply to children of school age
actually engaged in tilling the soil. A third type
of action is that which suspends the compulsory-attendance
law under certain conditions; such a
law is the so-called "Brown Bill," chapter 689 of
the Laws of 1917, New York legislature, to which
reference will be made later. Action may also be
taken in regard to shortening or lengthening the
established school year, shifting vacations, and
changing hours of session. For instance, the
Bureau of Education at Washington has suggested
keeping school open twelve months, and this advice
may be taken in some localities; it is possible, also,
that a continuation of the demand for agricultural
labor of students may result in a different allotment
of vacations in the apple- and peach-growing
sections, so that students employed in harvesting
may lose a minimum of school attendance.</p>

<p>Events moved very rapidly in the spring of 1917.
We were called upon by national and state governments,
by chambers of commerce and boards
of trade, by bankers and railroads, to raise crops.
We were told that America must be the pantry
for all Europe and that, do the best that we might,
we should not do overmuch. Obviously, with such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
authority back of a movement for increased agricultural
production, it did not take very long for
state boards of agriculture and state departments
of education to respond, to say nothing about the
propaganda set forth by settlements, women's clubs,
the Y.M.C.A., the Boy Scouts, the National Security
League, the Women's Patriotic Service League,
and a score of other organizations, that put a
psychological persuasion into the situation which
was hard for school authorities and school children
to resist.</p>

<p>The following data relative to the action of
a number of the states were compiled by the
National Child Labor Committee. In general the
data showed no provision made for supervision,
for physical examination, for wages, or for definition
of "passing grade." In some instances there
were even no age limitations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>California.</i> During continuance of state of war, state
board of education with approval of governor may reduce
school term to six months when necessary "for the planting
or harvesting of crops or for other agricultural or
horticultural purposes."</p>

<p><i>Indiana.</i> Letter from state superintendent of public instruction
to county superintendents, April 10, 1917, saying
in part: "It is my wish and order that you permit such
high-school girls and boys, and also such eighth-grade girls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
and boys as may care to engage in Home Projects work
looking toward the increase of our agricultural output, to
engage in such work and to receive therefor full credit on
the school records, provided this work is done to the satisfaction
of the county agent and the county superintendent."</p>

<p>Plan formulated later by principals and state superintendents
for supervising, certifying, and accrediting such work
did something to stop a general exodus, but came too late to
do much good.</p>

<p><i>Illinois.</i> State superintendent wrote to local superintendents,
April 10, advising that all boys eligible for working
certificates be excused from school May 1 and receive a
working certificate upon assurance that they have employment
on a farm or in a garden, credit to be given for work
upon guarantee that summer months have been spent in
farming or gardening.</p>

<p><i>Kansas.</i> State board of education advised local school
officials, April 17, that it would "approve granting a full
year's credit to pupils who have passing grade and who find
it necessary to withdraw from school before the end of the
school year either to enlist in the military service or actually
to engage directly in food production."</p>

<p><i>Maine.</i> Boys 16 and over excused from school attendance,
June 1 to October 31, for work on farms under supervision
of Y.M.C.A. official. (See chapter on "Farm Cadets.")</p>

<p><i>Maryland.</i> Superintendent of schools, Baltimore County,
in open letter to school officials, May 11, authorizes the
employment on farms of "boys and girls who are old
enough to be of real productive value." On days when not
so employed they are required to attend school. Children
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
over 13 who have attended school one hundred days during the
year may be employed without permits; those who have not
attended one hundred days must have permits. Children
under 13 must have a permit, "which should not be issued
to a child who is too immature to do work for which the
permit is asked." Permits issued for twenty days or less
may be renewed upon application of parent.</p>

<p>Similar plan was discussed by state board of education
but not approved on ground that it might lead to abrogation
of the laws on child-labor and school-attendance.</p>

<p><i>Missouri.</i> State superintendent of public schools wrote
to local officials April 13, suggesting that they "excuse at
once from high school all boys over 14 years of age who
will go to farms and work. Give them full credit for their
year's work at the end of the school year, with the standing
they have at present. Have the boy who gets the
credit give evidence satisfactory to you as to his work on
the farm. Include boys who live in the country and boys
who will go to the farm to work. Extend the same privilege
to girls where you deem it advisable."</p>

<p><i>New York.</i> (Referred to later in this chapter.)</p>

<p><i>North Dakota.</i> Attorney-general in open letter to school
officers, April, 1917, interprets section of school law exempting
children from school attendance in cases of necessity to
apply to children of school age actually engaged in tilling
the soil.</p>

<p>State superintendent of schools in open letter to school
officials, April, 1917, recommends that schools should not
open earlier than October 1, with a spring vacation of four
or five weeks, and that the school be kept open through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
June and July when there is less and cheaper farm work to
do. "This would make available, and with a minimum loss
of school time, some 5000 of the older boys at a time when
labor is scarce and wages are high."</p>

<p><i>Pennsylvania.</i> State board of education, April 19, issued
circular letter stating that farm and garden work should be
considered valid excuse for absence from school, and for
children 12 and over in good standing such work should
be credited in lieu of school attendance.</p>

<p><i>New Jersey.</i> State board of education sent out a circular
letter to superintendents and principals in which it was
stated that credit towards graduation might be given in place
of school work during the time a pupil was actually engaged
in farm work as a member of the Junior Industrial Army,
or while called out in the service of the state or of the
nation as a member of its organized military forces. (Boys
and girls over fourteen years of age are allowed to enroll in
the Industrial Army in the agricultural or home-garden or
the girls' service division.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Possibly no great harm was done by the action
of these state officials and state boards. Yet the
action affords food for thought; and perhaps the
best way to bring about reflection is to pass immediately,
without comment, to a quotation taken
from the London <i>Times</i> of July 19, 1917,&mdash;a quotation
which gives a picture of the end of the road
on which some of us in this country started in
the spring of 1917.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The reply, last week, of Herbert A. L. Fisher, Minister
of Education, to a deputation of the Committee on Wage-earning
Children was sympathetic and not merely a common-form
shelving of the issue. The deputation asked for
legislation restricting the labor of school children out of
school hours. The extent of the evil was indicated by the
deputation, but it is doubtful if even the educational public
know how widespread and deleterious it is. On October 5,
1915, we pointed out that nearly half a million children
between the ages of 12 and 14 years were receiving no
education, or no education worth having, and that all of
these were at work which led nowhither at the very age
when their moral and physical development was at stake.
Since then the conditions which we condemned have passed
from bad to worse. Many thousands of children under the
age of 12, under the ages of even 10 and 11, are at work,
and willingly at work, since the younger the child, the more
readily it responds to the demand for helpfulness. Mr. Fisher
cannot but realize the evil of this exploitation of young children
by parents and tradesmen. It is an evil affecting not
only the efficiency of school life but our whole economic
system. There never was an economic need for this child
labor, and the Board of Education admitted in their circular
to local authorities last week that there is no economic need
in rural districts for such labor even now. This circular
was a letter from the National Service Department and
dealt with the pressure on education authorities in rural
areas to release boys and girls under 12 for service on
the land. The letter definitely states that, in view of the
labor released from the army and the number of women
now available, "it would appear that there should be no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
necessity for such a serious interruption as is contemplated
of the education of the nation's children."</p>

<p>This should suffice to determine the policy of the rural-education
authorities. But the position in towns is even
more urgent, and Mr. Fisher and the government might give
additional powers to local authorities to deal with the labor
of children in full-time school attendance. It was certainly
a mistake in the legislation of 1913 to make it possible for
the street trading of such children to receive official recognition.
But street trading is not the chief cause of anxiety.
Another is the employment of little children by shopkeepers
and distributing agencies before school, in the dinner interval,
and after school. The local authorities should be empowered
to forbid all employment for wages of children under 12
and to restrict within very narrow limits the employment of
children at school under 14.</p>

<p>Naturally Mr. Fisher must not overburden or imperil
his bill, or interfere with the labor necessary for the war.
He cannot be expected to change the face of England in
a moment. But he can strike deep without disturbing the
organization of society. He can transform from below by
ameliorating the conditions of very young children. The
country is ready now for changes that seemed Utopian
two years ago. By means of nursery schools the nation is
dealing at last with the raw material that is to be the England
of to-morrow. The same principle should be followed
in the case of children between the ages of 6 and 12 years.
The physical welfare of these children is of the first
importance. Yet between these ages thousands, through
the carrying of heavy weights and other means of over-strain,
are receiving life-long physical injury. All efforts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
for educational reform are being balked by their employment.
The elaborate scheme of the Half-Time Council,
which was reported in our last issue, depends, as indeed
practically all of the reform schemes and Mr. Fisher's own
proposals depend, on the physical efficiency of the children.
The deputation asked that provision should be made for the
education of children abnormally employed during the war.</p></blockquote>

<p>Out of all the literature which has been put
forth on the relationship of children to industry in
war time it would appear that Dr. Claxton, United
States Commissioner of Education, most adequately
states the fundamental principles, in his circular
letter to the educational authorities of the country
issued in June, 1917. Portions of his letter bear
directly upon employment of children in time of war.
Other portions are closely related to statements in
other chapters. It is well worth quoting in full:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is of the utmost importance that there shall be no
lowering in the efficiency of our systems of education.
Schools and other agencies of education must be maintained
at whatever necessary cost and against all hurtful
interference with their regular work except as may be
necessary for the national defense, which is, of course, our
immediate task and must be kept constantly in mind and
have right of way everywhere and at all times. From
the beginning of our participation in the war we should
avoid the mistakes which some other countries have made
to their hurt and which they are now trying to correct.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>If the war should be long and severe, there will be
great need in its later days for many young men and
women of scientific knowledge, training, and skill; and it
may then be much more difficult than it is now to support
our schools, to spare our children and youth from other
service, and to permit them to attend school. Therefore no
school should close its doors now or shorten its term
unnecessarily. All young men and women in college
should remain and use their time to the very best advantage,
except such as may find it necessary to leave for
immediate profitable employment in some productive occupation
or for the acceptance of some position in some
branch of the military service, which position cannot be
so well filled by anyone else. All children in the elementary
schools and as nearly as possible all high-school
pupils should remain in school through the entire session.</p>

<p>When the war is over, whether within a few months or
after many years, there will be such demands upon this
country for men and women of scientific knowledge, technical
skill, and general culture as have never before come
to any country. The world must be rebuilt. This country
must play a far more important part than it has in the
past in agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce, and
also in the things of cultural life&mdash;art, literature, music,
scientific discovery.</p>

<p>Russia and China are awakening to new life and are on
the eve of great industrial development. They will ask of
us steel, engines, and cars for railroads, agricultural implements,
and machinery for industrial plants. They will also
ask for men to install these and to direct much of their
development in every line. England, France, Italy, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
the central empires have thrown into battle a very large
per cent of their educated and trained men, including most
of the young professors and instructors in their universities,
colleges, and <i>gymnasia</i>, <i>lycées</i>, and public schools. Their
colleges and universities are almost empty. The young
men who would under normal conditions be receiving the
education and training necessary to prepare them for leadership
in the future development of these countries are
fighting and dying in the trenches. All these countries
must needs go through a long period of reconstruction,
industrially and in many other respects. Our own trained
men and women should be able and ready to render every
possible assistance. It should be remembered that the
number of students in our universities, colleges, normal
schools, and technical schools is very small as compared
with the total number of persons of producing age&mdash;little
more than one half of 1 per cent. The majority of
these students are young men and women who are becoming
more mature and fit for service. The older of the
60,000,000 men and women of producing age are growing
more unfit and are passing beyond the age of service.
It should also be remembered that the more mature the
young men who volunteer for service in the army, the more
valuable their services will be.</p>

<p>Therefore a right conception of patriotism should induce
all students who cannot render some immediate service of
great value to remain in college, concentrate their energies
on their college work, and thus be all the more ready and
fit when their services may be needed either for war or for
the important work of reconstruction and development in our
own and other countries when the war shall have ended.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>All schools, of whatever grade, should remain open with
their full quota of officers and teachers. The salaries of
teachers should not be lowered in this time of unusual
high cost of living. When possible, salaries should be
increased in proportion to the services rendered. Since
the people will be taxed heavily by the federal government
for the payment of the expenses of the war, teachers
should be willing to continue to do their work, and do it
as well as they can, as a patriotic service, even if their
salaries cannot now be increased. All equipment necessary
for the best use of the time of teachers and students
should be provided, as should all necessary increase of
room, but costly building should not be undertaken now
while the prices of building material are excessively high
and while there are urgent and unfilled demands for labor
in industries pertaining directly and immediately to the
national defense. Schools should be continued in full
efficiency, but in most instances costly building may well
be postponed.</p>

<p>During school hours and out of school, on mornings,
afternoons, Saturdays, and during vacation all older children
and youth should be encouraged and directed to do as much
useful productive work as they can without interfering with
their more important school duties. This productive work
should be so directed as to give it the highest possible value,
both economically and educationally. For children and youth
in schools of all grades there will be need of more effective
moral training, and provision should be made for this.
While the war for the safety of democracy is in progress,
and when it is over, there will be greater need for effective
machinery for the promotion of intelligent discussion of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
principles of democracy and all that pertains to the public
welfare of local communities, counties, states, and the nation.
To this end every schoolhouse should be made a community
center and civic forum with frequent meetings for the discussion
of matters of public interest and for social intercourse.</p></blockquote>

<p>One phrase in Commissioner Claxton's letter is
especially significant. It is <i>This productive work
should be so directed as to give it the highest possible
value</i>, <i>both economically and educationally</i>. In this
whole question of children and industry in war
time, we are brought face to face with several facts.
The first is that industry, both agricultural and
manufacturing, will demand the services of children.
Second, that organizations like state and national
child-labor committees, which have fought for the
welfare and development of American children, will
continue to oppose all attempts to break down the
school system through relaxation of the enforcement
of compulsory-education laws, or to break
down the labor laws either by giving young children
special permits to work or by exempting certain
establishments from the laws limiting hours
of labor. Third, that the children themselves will
desire to work rather than go to school. The comparatively
high wages which will exist during a war
emergency will call them as can no course of study.
Fourth, that families whose earning member or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
members are off to war, and who feel in addition
the higher cost of living, will look upon their children
as being a possible added source of income.
And fifth, that school authorities will thus stand
amidst half a dozen fires. Some will back against
the wall and say: "I don't believe in closing the
schools," "Under no conditions will the child-labor
laws in this state be relaxed," "The war hysteria
makes me enforce child-labor laws more vigorously
than ever," "Children have plenty of time to garden
after school." Others will, under pressure, lose their
heads, and shut their eyes to the fact that children
are working illegally. Some may seek for a "reasonable
excuse," and they can find plenty of such excuses
by referring to the action in England. Still
others will go on peacefully without thought or
action one way or the other. But the rest, and it
is to be hoped that their numbers are legion, will
try to discover some means of making this emergency
count in an educational way. Here are some
of the factors which enter into the situation.</p>

<p>In the first place, children like to work, that is,
outside of school, and these work impulses of youth
ought to be organized to contribute to the educative
process. It is readily enough granted that
they have not been in the past. In fact, these
work impulses have been exploited for private gain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Now, on account of the war, they are aroused to
a high pitch, and we ought to be able to organize
them in connection with the new work opportunities
for higher economic efficiency as well as for
higher social efficiency.</p>

<p>In the second place, it is doubtful whether we
can much longer continue the policy of increasing
the regular attendance of youth at school without
giving some consideration to the educative value of
labor. The educative process taken in its largest
sense goes on for twenty-four hours a day. It concerns
health, character, mental capacity, citizenship,
and useful work. To most people the educative process
merely centers around the schoolhouse, and such
think of education in terms of schooling. To them,
to increase the number of years that youth is
obliged to go to school is to increase the number of
years given over directly to the educative process.
But the child goes to school for about five hours
a day for five days in the week for about thirty-six
weeks in the year, and in this time he deals largely
with books; and many find it a reasonable excuse,
because they are "going to school" and "getting
an education," to avoid any useful work. Now some
kinds of work are wholesome and educative. Most
farm work comes in the class of useful and profitable
employment. When the hours are not too long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
and the factories and stores are sanitary and the pay
is reasonable, work in these places may be profitable
to youth. Because this is not always the case is no
reason why we should not attempt to make it so.</p>

<p>It would seem that educators now occupy a strategic
position from which they may exert a tremendous
influence in the direction of standardizing
the work of juveniles in terms of the deepest social
significance, and a good start in this direction may be
made in meeting the war emergency. The subject is
so large and the previous discussion of it so limited
that we have not very much background on which
to work, and it is not advisable at this time to do
more than merely hint at some possible procedures.</p>

<p>First, why not have the rural schools for children
up to 12 years of age open early in September and
close the first of August, and make provision for
stopping the school work of the youngest children
during the winter months in those parts of the
country where it is difficult for them to reach
school? Why not organize classes in dandelion
digging, berry picking, currant picking, and even,
once in a while, weeding, by having a series of field
and harvesting days under the direction of the
school teacher with the coöperation of the parents?
Why not have able-bodied boys in these rural
schools released from book work in April and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
remain out of school until the first of November,
and then require them to attend school faithfully
for six days a week during the rest of the year?
Why not have the boys between 14 and 16 drop
out of school in June and July to pick small fruits
and berries and to work in vegetable gardens?
Under certain conditions, in regions where such
service can be used,&mdash;which is not often,&mdash;they
might stay out in September to pick fruits and
gather small crops.</p>

<p>Of course it is to be expected that the answer
to all of these questions will be a most emphatic
No. Yet they have not been set up primarily
because the farmer tells us that he needs labor,
but rather because it is felt that boys need labor;
that is, useful labor.</p>

<p>Second, why not devise in cities a scheme of
part-time education for youths between 14 and 18
years of age who will be needed in the war
emergency in factories and stores, as well as for
youths who need useful labor as a part of the
educative process? If the war falls heavily upon
us in America, we shall find that these children
will go anyway. We shall find that the male
teachers who teach them will be drafted. We may
even find&mdash;although it is hoped not&mdash;that the
school buildings will be taken over for military
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
purposes. But I am not thinking particularly of
war needs. I am thinking of child needs. England
proposes to reintroduce into the school system
children who are now abnormally employed in
the war. It further proposes to develop out of
its war experience, on a large scale, the part-time
and continuation-school idea. It is reported that
in France a part-time and continuation-school bill
will be introduced in 1918.</p>

<p>Now why not take hold of this whole matter
of juvenile employment in a constructive way?
As long as war is upon us we have better opportunity
than ever of passing through the legislature
part-time and continuation-school measures. We
have at the same time, out of all the experience
of England, every opportunity to formulate laws
for the employment of juveniles in a way which
will not break down the educative process, but
will rather build it up; and above everything else
we ought to enforce strictly all child-labor and
compulsory-education laws which we have on the
statute books. We may modify them, if we will,
to meet war emergencies, if it appears absolutely
necessary, but better than that, we may reconstruct
them in the interests of the educative value of
labor when combined with proper rules and regulations
relative to the employment of children.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>Furthermore, why not find some way of bringing
agriculture into the educative process of the
city boy? Would it not be a good idea to establish
country branches for city schools, providing for the
older boys a winter course of study in the science
of agriculture, together with the ordinary academic
branches of secondary-school education, followed in
the spring by practice in an agricultural training
camp? Later on in the season they would go out
to work individually or in groups for farmers. (See
chapter on "Farm Cadets.") The older of these
boys would make admirable assistant teachers and
supervisors for the younger group of 14-year-old
to 15-year-old boys who would be sent to these
camps after schools had closed. We cannot much
longer avoid the question of bringing agriculture
to the city boy or, rather, taking the city boy to
agriculture; and the past summer's experience with
city boys working on farms brought forcibly to our
attention the advantages of a closer relationship
between city children and country life.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the modification in
1917 of the school-attendance law of New York
State. Three sections of the act by which these
modifications were made are quoted in full, as they
represent legislative action as well as discretionary
powers of the state educational official.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> The provisions of Art. XXIII of the education
law, relative to the compulsory education of children,
may, in the discretion of the Commissioner of Education,
be suspended for the period between the first day of April
and the first day of November of each year, or any portion
thereof, during the time that this act shall remain in effect,
for the purpose of aiding and performing labor in the cultivation,
production, and care of food products upon farms
and gardens within the state. Such suspension shall be
subject to such conditions, restrictions, and limitations as
may be imposed by the Commissioner of Education, and
shall be subject to rules and regulations to be prescribed
by him. In case of such suspension, provision shall be
made for the welfare and protection of the children affected
thereby, and during the period of such suspension and while
engaged in such work, they shall be under the supervision
and direction of the school authorities of the city or district
in which they reside....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 4.</span> A pupil in the public schools or in any
state school or institution who is relieved from school work
and is engaged satisfactorily in agricultural service during
the present school year shall be given credit for the work
of the present term without examination, on the certificate
of the person in charge of such school or institution that
his work therein up to the time of engaging in such service
is satisfactory. A pupil in such school or institution who
engages in such service during the present school year shall
not incur any loss of standing or credit on account of such
service. All pupils in public schools who are candidates
for college-entrance diplomas or other credentials to be
issued to them at the close of the present school year shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
be granted such diplomas or credentials on the certificate
of the principal of the school that their work up to the
time of engaging in such service is satisfactory. The
Regents of the University shall make rules for the purpose
of giving credit to pupils in the public schools who have
been in attendance at school during the present school year
and who have left the schools for the purpose of rendering
agricultural or industrial service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 5.</span> The Commissioner of Education shall cause
appropriate certificates or badges to be prepared and issued
to pupils in the schools of the state who shall perform satisfactory
agricultural or industrial service under rules and
regulations of the Commissioner of Education.</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be noted that the compulsory-attendance
law was suspended only between certain periods
and at the discretion of the Commissioner of Education,
and for the sole purpose of permitting
children to labor in the cultivation, production,
and care of food products upon farms and gardens
within the state.</p>

<p>This bill did not authorize the employment of
girls in general domestic service. No provision of
the labor law was repealed, suspended, or modified,
and the provisions of the labor law relating to the
employment of children in canneries or in any
factory or mercantile establishment still remain
in force. It is true that a bill suspending temporarily
in whole or in part, at the discretion of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
Industrial Commission, provisions of the labor law
in relation to any employment in the state passed
the two legislative bodies, but this was wisely vetoed
by Governor Whitman.</p>

<p>It will be further noticed that the children thus
employed within the dates mentioned are to be
under the supervision and direction of the school
authorities in the city or district in which such
children reside. The Commissioner of Education
thereupon issued certain regulations relating to
children who might be employed within the compulsory
school ages. A brief summary follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Boys only, 15 years of age and above, residing in cities.</p>

<p>Boys only, 14 years of age and above, residing elsewhere
than in a city.</p>

<p>Girls, 14 years of age, and above, residing outside of cities,
may work at home in the district in which such girls reside,
or at a place sufficiently near such girls' homes as to
afford supervision by their parents.</p>

<p>No child shall be employed or permitted to work on
farms and gardens until such child shall obtain a farm-garden
permit.</p>

<p>No child shall receive a farm-garden permit who does
not present to the issuing officer the written consent of his
parent or guardian and who is not found to be physically
competent to perform the labor proposed.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the chapter on "Our Colleges and Technical
Institutes" reference was made to resolutions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
the Board of Regents and to the fact that the
State Education Department formulated a plan
for enlisting and placing high-school boys on the
farms, for directing and supervising the work of
such boys, and for the adjustment of school credits.
With this resolution in mind the Commissioner
of Education sent out, on April 16, the following
letter to all school superintendents and school
principals of the state.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To meet the present national emergency, the New York
State Education Department, after careful consideration,
issues the following regulations concerning matters that
vitally affect the interests of the pupils of the secondary
schools of the state.</p>

<p>1. The June Regents' examinations will be given as
previously announced for all pupils who remain regularly
in school and also for pupils who may enlist for service
and who wish to take the examinations and are situated so
that they can do so. For the latter class the time requirement
will be waived.</p>

<p>2. Announcement is made to all the schools of the state
that any pupil who enlists for military service or who enlists
for and renders satisfactory agricultural or industrial service
will be credited with the work of the present term without
examination on the certificate of the school that his work
up to the time of enlistment is satisfactory.</p>

<p>3. Candidates for college-entrance diplomas who are in
the graduating class of 1917 will be granted the diploma
on certificate of the principal that their work up to the time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
of enlistment is satisfactory. The average standing will be
computed on the basis of the examinations already passed.</p>

<p>4. Appropriate certificates will be prepared to be issued
to those pupils in the schools who shall enlist for agricultural
or industrial service and who shall present satisfactory
evidence of such service.</p>

<p>5. That all other questions regarding conditions affecting
the 1918 high-school class be held in abeyance to await
developments.</p>

<p>It is believed that principals, teachers, and pupils in all
secondary schools of the state will appreciate the vital importance
of prompt action in the present crisis and that
each will esteem it a privilege to "do his bit" for the
common good.</p></blockquote>

<p>As soon as the schoolboys of the state knew
of this letter, they all seemed to hear very suddenly
of jobs on farms, but some, rather unfortunately,
failed to continue to hear this call when the end
of the school year came and they could no longer
receive school credit for work on the farm because,
of course, school had closed. It being likely that
there would be the same general tendency for the
boys to discover work on farms about the first of
September when the schools open, it was thought
well to have a clear understanding of the conditions
of release of boys for farm work in the fall.
Of course a great many boys were out of school
during May and June and continued to work all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
summer on individual farms or in camps with
other boys, but "slackers" wanted to stop as soon
as they received their school credit, and the same
slackers might be just as slack in returning to
school, hence the following letter issued by the
Commissioner of Education on August 11, 1917:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To Superintendents, Principals, and Boards of Education:</p>

<p>In answer to many inquiries as to releasing boys for
farm service this fall, and in response to the appeal of the
Food Supply Commission, which states the imperative need
of such labor as the youth of this state can give in harvesting
the crops, I would urge the educational authorities of
the state in those sections where the need exists to make
all possible provision for the special tuition of those pupils
who may, under the labor laws of the state and the compulsory-education
laws, legally engage in such service. Such
special instruction, either after hours or in holiday periods,
may be the special patriotic contribution of some teachers
to meet the need which seems at present to demand whatever
coöperation the school authorities can give. This will
be most easily arranged by limiting the enlistments, as far
as possible, to the upper classes, and by arranging for work
in relays, so that the period of absences may not be unnecessarily
long. We ought not to remit in the slightest our
educational requirements and disciplines, nor take children
or youth out of the educational processes, but we ought to
do all that we can, on the other hand, to make it possible
for the boys of proper age and strength to perform this
service when it is of real public necessity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<p>The department, wishing to coöperate to this end, makes
the following determination, effective until November 1, 1917:</p>

<p>The time of study requirements for admission to the
Regents' examinations, in January and June, 1918, may be
waived in the case of any pupil who presents evidence that</p>

<p><i>a.</i> He was regularly registered in school at or near the
beginning of the term in September, 1917. (Boys already
at work at a distance from the school may, with the permission
of the local principal, register by mail.)</p>

<p><i>b.</i> He was released by the principal from school for agricultural
service.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> He was actually and satisfactorily engaged in needed
agricultural service while absent from school.</p>

<p>This privilege should be interpreted conservatively.
School authorities should excuse pupils from this service
only where the need is urgent and where it is possible to
maintain such supervision that certificate of the facts can be
made from certain knowledge.</p></blockquote>

<p>During the summer and fall of 1917, schoolboys
from Maine to California responded to the nation's
call for increased food production. Other seasons of
scarcity of labor, with the shortage of farm and
garden products and resultant high prices, are
doubtless before us. Indeed, we are told that for
five years at least we are to continue to feel the
stress of labor shortage due to war and other conditions.
The United States Boys' Working Reserve,
through state councils of defense and state and
national departments of labor and agriculture, will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
continue to issue proclamations calling upon youth
to serve the nation. Legislatures will pass or amend
laws permitting absences from school for industrial
and farm service. State educational officials will
issue edicts interpreting legislative action. Schools
will devise methods of giving school credit for useful
service. Boys will again leave school to earn and
serve. Parents will continue to speak with pride of
the earning of their lads or complain about their
treatment. Farmers will recall their first experiences
with city boys. Everything will center about
products, laws, rules, school credits, and dollars.</p>

<p>Few of us will think of the deeper significance of
what is behind. We shall hardly realize that the law-makers
have thought only of a possible increase of
acreage under cultivation, or increased production
in factories; that the farmers and the manufacturers
had visions merely of good labor at a low figure;
that the parents saw only an opportunity for a
"change for the boy"; that the boy had in mind
only a spending account and release from school.</p>

<p>We shall forget our unscientific experiments, the
light handling and selfish exploitation we have
given to that wonderful possession of youth&mdash;the
work impulses. And the question we should ask
ourselves is, What educational justification have we
for this service which the boys have rendered?

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>ORGANIZED BOY POWER VS. MILITARY DRILL</small></h2>

<p>The war has already brought about drastic economic
changes in Europe. The recall of men from
the trenches to perform a more useful professional
and industrial service behind the lines has demonstrated
the importance of the supporting civilian
army. From the viewpoint of the individual, nothing
can equal the supreme sacrifice of a life. "What
good," wailed a Yiddish woman on the East Side of
New York City, "is a free country to me if my Abie
is killed?" But in the judgment of the nation the
garment worker, Abie, who is drafted into service in
the army is of no greater value than his friend the
skilled machinist who is allowed to remain in his
present occupation. The military exemptions of men
in European armies, the adoption of the selective
draft in the United States, are acknowledgments of
the equality of the military and the civilian occupations
indispensable to military activity. To include
in our educational law such a recognition, adopting
a measure permitting the substitution of types of
vocational training for military training, is but to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
follow the lead of the national government in declaring
such exemptions a military necessity. New York
State has made a beginning in this direction.</p>

<p>In 1916 the legislature enacted the so-called
"Welsh-Slater" bills, making military and physical
training compulsory in the secondary schools of
the state for boys above 16 and under 19 years
of age. Such military training is to aggregate not
more than three hours each week between September
first of each year and June fifteenth of the
next. The law further provides, within the limits
of appropriation, for the establishment of military
camps with attendance of from two to four weeks.
While the operation of these camps and, indeed,
the introduction of military drill, have been imperfectly
carried out, owing to the lack of suitable
state appropriation to carry on the work on the
necessary and large scale for a working-boy and
schoolboy population of 240,000, it is the intention
of the Military Training Commission to insist on
the requirements of the law.</p>

<p>The law as passed in 1916 contained a significant
clause relative to the excusing of boys exempted
by the Military Training Commission. It was felt
by the critics of the bill that, although the law
requiring military and physical training was a movement
in the right direction, it left much to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
desired. The ambiguous word "exemptions" is one
subject to fine distinctions. Furthermore, it was
felt that the law was essentially one of discrimination.
The schoolboy of 16 to 19 was in an exclusive
military class, set apart, in his capacity to be
trained for national service, from the employed boy
of the same years.</p>

<p>It is not easy to justify the selection of the high-school
pupils of the state as the only young people
who shall be the recipients of military training. The
report of the New Jersey commission appointed
to study military training in its relation to high
schools covers this point admirably.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The duty of the common defense is one which belongs
properly to all who are physically capable, and none should
be deprived of the opportunity of qualifying himself, if such
opportunity is offered to any, to perform this duty effectively.
It cannot be claimed that the boys of the high
schools are exceptional, and that they are the only ones
who can receive this instruction profitably. If there is any
advantage in it, all boys equal in age and physique to high-school
boys can receive it with equal probability of profit.
If it is claimed that the reason for providing this instruction
for the high schools is that the pupils can best afford
the time for it, it must be answered that very many of
these derive an income from labor out of school hours
which enables them to attend school. These are as worthy
of exemption from military instruction as those who leave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
school because they lack the ambition to continue their
education, or because they are compelled to do so by circumstances.
Whether this instruction is compulsory or optional
with pupils of the high schools, if required or offered at
all, it should apply to all boys, out of school as well as in
school, of prescribed ages and strength.</p>

<p>Military training and service, if they are necessary, are
obligations of citizenship, not of education alone.</p>

<p>It is difficult to contemplate with satisfaction or even
complacency the social cleavage which is bound to result
from a system of military instruction which is applied to
high-school pupils and not to other boys. To assign or
reserve the privilege, or duty, or obligation, however it is
regarded, of preparing to fight for the country to the better-educated
class is just as repugnant to democratic ideals as
was the practice in days long gone by of leaving it to the
nobility. To select high-school pupils for this training is
open to the same objection as would be a plan of selecting
adults for actual military service solely on the basis of their
occupations or professions&mdash;a plan which would receive no
consideration.</p>

<p>Military authorities admit that the fundamental aim of
every form of military training must be to cultivate physical
health and strength. As Dr. George Fisher, secretary of the
Physical Department, International Committee, Y.M.C.A.,
and a member of the New York State Military Training
Commission, puts it, "In the training camps in England
it takes a full year to get the men in condition after they
enlist. England's experience in this war indicates that the
big problem is not primarily the training of the men on military
tactics or drill, but conditioning the men. Therefore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
the lesson to us should be to discover what methods can best
be used to put and keep men in good physical condition."</p>

<p>If any evidence of the accuracy of this opinion were
needed, it is necessary only to consult the records of the
United States War Department. The following table shows
the number of applicants for enlistment in the United States
army, furnished by the several recruiting districts, together
with the number accepted or rejected in said districts, fiscal
years ending June 30, 1911 to June 30, 1915:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order, therefore, that all citizens may be properly
trained and prepared to perform effectively all their duties,
no matter what they may be, we recommend and strongly
urge that the necessary steps be taken to provide for all
the schools of the state a complete and thorough system
of physical training. This system should be compulsory for
all pupils, and should include carefully selected exercises
adapted to the different ages of pupils, and designed to
protect their health, stimulate bodily functions, and promote
physical strength. It should apply to all girls as well as
boys. It should aim to prevent bodily abnormalities or deformities,
or to correct them if they are found to exist. It
should include personal and community sanitation, first aid
in emergencies, bandaging, and all forms of instruction in
personal safety. It should encourage outdoor activities. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
should provide abundant games for all pupils in which group
activities are prominent, and in which appeal may be made
to the spirit of competition. It may include those features of
military drill which properly serve the purposes of physical
training, but which must be regarded as subordinate to these
purposes. It may even include practice with the miniature
or the service rifle, if such practice is regarded as necessary
to develop steadiness of nerve, bodily control, and accuracy
of sight. In the case of such exercises the educational error
does not lie in their use, but in the exaggerated military
purpose which they are made to serve. All the features and
exercises of the thorough course of physical training which
we recommend should be intimately connected and interrelated,
on the one hand with the moral or character-forming
instruction of the schools and on the other with the complete
provisions for medical inspection which have already
been made compulsory by law.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now boy service should be democratic. The exemptions,
whatever they are, must be made on a
basis of the equality of the schoolboy and the boy
engaged in wage-earning. A boy should not be
excused from his rightful preparedness training because
he happens to be employed as a bell boy in
a metropolitan hotel. Such work is not industrially
productive, nor could any devised system of military
equivalents make it a substitution for personal
contribution to national preparedness.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1917 the legislature amended
the law to include all boys&mdash;a drafting of the boy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
power of the state in much the same way that the
European nations in conflict make provisions for
the full utilization of man power. An additional
amendment, as stated in chapter 49, Laws of 1917,
reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Such requirement as to military training may, in the
discretion of the commission, be met in part by such vocational
training or vocational experience as will, in the opinion
of the commission, specifically prepare boys of the ages
named for service useful to the state, in the maintenance
of defense, in the promotion of public safety, in the conservation
and development of the state's resources, or in
the construction and maintenance of public improvement.</p></blockquote>

<p>The commission was given power to establish
a bureau of vocational training. This, through
careful inspection of the work of boys of the ages
named in industrial, commercial, and agricultural
pursuits, will determine the types of vocational
training or vocational experience which, in the
opinion of the commission, specifically prepare
boys for service useful to the state.</p>

<p>Such a bureau would, under normal conditions,
appoint a few inspectors and investigators to study
conditions in order that carefully laid plans might
be made for carrying out the provisions of the
amendment. But war emergency in the matter of
food supply gave the Military Training Commission
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
an opportunity to organize at short notice one
branch of military-equivalent service, that is, the
farm-cadet unit, and it extended an offer of assistance
to the Food Supply Commission to organize
farm-cadet bureaus in each of the six military
zones of the state. Through these the Military
Training Commission has been useful in placing
boys upon farms, and in following up such farm
service with a view not only to determining its
merit as an equivalent or partial equivalent for
military service but also (with the coöperation of
church and business organizations, the Y.M.C.A.,
and the Boy Scouts) to giving the task which
these boys have been doing on the farms its
proper place in relation to the physical, mental,
and social ideals which lie outside the hard and
often unfamiliar round of field work.</p>

<p>Important as this farm-cadet service has been in
the matter of looking toward increased production,
a more significant work to be developed by the
Bureau of Vocational Training is that of interpreting
the spirit and purpose of the amendment already
referred to, which states that provisions for the
military-training requirement may be met in part
by certain types of vocational training or vocational
experience. The whole program of physical, military,
and vocational training is most significant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
wholesome, and far-reaching. It is a program of
universal training which will be serviceable for war
and peace alike&mdash;a program which will require every
boy to prepare himself to offer some service in case
of need, and which stamps that service as equally
patriotic with the narrower military service in which
most of the world's supreme valors have been recorded.
As John Finley, Commissioner of Education
in New York State and one of the members
of its Military Training Commission, puts it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In this amended law we have a program providing, on
the one hand, for the defensive training of the soldier and,
on the other hand, for the effective mobilization of the resources
of the nation in training boys for vocations&mdash;which
training of itself exalts and identifies as patriotic service all
the effective activities of our everyday life. It is a constructive
provision for what would have to be done otherwise
in time of need through exemptions.</p>

<p>England has had to reach such a program through an
exempting provision in her plan of coöperative service.
France has had to come to it by taking men from the
front for service behind the lines. Germany is finding it
necessary, in the midst of war, to organize her entire man
power.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is most important that this vocational training
or experience should be <i>conscious</i> service. The boy
who offers it must clearly understand why it is
accepted in part for the required military drill.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
To fail to inform him is to take from his military
equivalent the educational value given it by the law.</p>

<p>Dr. Finley, in his inimitable way, expresses
this conscious service as it might apply to an adult
loyal citizenship:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I make this idea graphic to myself by thinking that
every man has an imaginary uniform (as every German
soldier and French soldier had in waiting his green-gray or
his blue and red uniform), an imaginary uniform of his
own measurements always in readiness in home or shop or
office or in some public locker, that he may don at call of
his community, state, or nation, or perhaps at world need,
when under compulsion he goes to vote, to pay his taxes,
to fight against dishonesty, inefficiency, or waste, to inform
himself upon public questions, or upon his public duties,
just as one studies tactics in order to help in his country's
defense, or goes to school as an alien to learn the language
and institutions of a new land, or joins his neighbors in
promoting the health of his community, in conserving resources,
in securing means of healthful recreation for children
and youth, in improving the highways&mdash;when, in
short, he performs any one of a hundred offices that are
required of him as an efficient unit in an organized society.</p></blockquote>

<p>Those who oppose military training in the
schools will be less critical of its requirements
when they are open to the broader interpretation
suggested in the amendment of 1917. Those to
whom the thought of training the young in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
carrying of arms is repugnant may here see the
educative value of universal service. Early in
the war Germany discovered that the relation of
industrial to military service is 2.7 per cent; that
is, to keep one man in the field, nearly three men
must work in those occupations, industrial and
agricultural, which support the nation at war.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> It
is the work of the New York Military Training
Commission to select as a partial military equivalent
such vocational training or vocational experience
as will, in the present or in the future,
serve the nation.</p>

<p>What shall the nature of this work be? The
decision is to be left to the state Military Training
Commission. It is easy to weed out those occupations
which have no national productive or defensive
value, but there will be difficulty in selecting
those vocations which may or may not be military
equivalents, which under war conditions may belong
to the work of an industrial or agricultural army,
when in peace they seem entirely separate from
national service. Such an occupation is that of a
junior telegraph operator, which is not of a productive
nature, and yet a very necessary factor in
war equipment. The case of a printer's apprentice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
is less equivocal. Only in rare cases could his
work be accepted as a partial substitute for the
required service.</p>

<p>The problem is not to separate the useful from
the useless occupations, but to discriminate between
those which may be called upon to serve the state
and those which have value only to the individual.
All the productive and useful occupations are not
socialized; and in selecting those which are partial
equivalents for the required military drill, we have
to make a distinction which has not been hitherto
considered in economic classification of occupations.</p>

<p>To Ruskin's generation his suggestion that
Oxford and Cambridge undergraduates should
serve short periods as builders of roads for the
empire seemed little short of fantastic. And yet
the turn of time may even bring about the confirmation
of this anomaly.</p>

<p>There is a parallel between the economic substitution
for military drill and what William James
in an astonishingly pertinent essay written in 1910
calls the "Moral Equivalent of War."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If there were, instead of military conscription, a conscription
of the whole youthful population to form for a
certain number of years a part of the army enlisted against
<i>Nature</i>,... the military ideals of hardihood and discipline
would be wrought into the growing fiber of the people....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
To coal and iron mines, to freight trains, to fishing fleets in
December, to dishwashing, clothes-washing and window-washing,
to road-building and tunnel-making, to foundries
and stokeholes, and to the frames of skyscrapers, would our
gilded youths be drafted off, according to their choice, to
get the childishness knocked out of them, and to come
back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer
ideas.... Such a conscription, with the state of public
opinion that would have required it, and the many moral
fruits it would bear, would preserve in the midst of a pacific
civilization the manly virtues which the military party is so
afraid of seeing disappear in peace.</p></blockquote>

<p>Liberty Hyde Bailey, author and farmer, formerly
director of the New York State College of Agriculture,
in a chapter of a recent book on "Universal
Service" expresses in concrete terms a similar
thought from the angle of the open country.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not of all persons will be required the same duty. What
one is, that shall one give. Society will learn of every man
and woman what these gifts may be. Some day it will be
expected that every able person will report himself, at determined
occasions, for definite service, without pay, in one
or more of the following privileges, and other privileges,
under orderly management and recognized public authority:</p>

<p>1. To clean up the earth and to keep it sweet,&mdash;streets,
roads, paths, byways, vacant lots, stream banks, woods, fields,
and all open, or public, properties and public works. The
clean-up days now becoming popular are the beginnings. Of
course this does not mean that the work of street-cleaning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
departments and the like is to be taken over or interfered
with; but there are times for special house cleaning. If
every person felt it devolving on him to help in keeping
the earth decent, he would be likely to exercise a proper
restraint in befouling it; and as charity begins at home, so
should his restraint begin on his own premises, even extending
to the parts out of sight of the public.</p>

<p>2. To take part in the construction of halls and premises
for community activities.</p>

<p>3. To aid in the making of beautiful and public places
accessible and to protect them. Every community with a
rural environment, and practically every small city, has
a near-by area that could be reserved and opened by coöperative
action of the people,&mdash;days set aside when paths
should be made, bridges built, retreats discovered, trees and
streams put in shape, insects destroyed. Such reservations
are not really public until the people volunteer to help in
them.</p>

<p>The farther places, the real backgrounds of the race, will
some day be opened as well as reserved, and made of much
use to very many people besides casual visitors and sight-seers.
We shall learn how to project whole counties and
cities, and even larger units, into the making and keeping
of them in a way that is not yet visioned. This can be
accomplished as easily as armies can be sent into the field,
but it will require a type of organization at which we have
not yet arrived. It will be worth while to develop public-service
armies.</p>

<p>4. To demand the freedom of the earth for its inhabitants,
under proper recognition of vested rights. The
conception of the freedom of the sea has had an interesting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
evolution,&mdash;the escape from the old sea fear, the long
years of piracy, the buccaneers, letters of marque and reprisal,
treaty ports, smuggling, and all the rest; finally has
come the demand of equal opportunities for all and the
open door. We must have the open door to fields and
shores, to commanding hills that should not be exclusive
property; find trails and walks and avenues to places the
people ought to know. All this requires exploration, tramps
far and near, maps, propaganda. All scenic parts will be
marked. The public shall know all good places.</p>

<p>5. To protect the products of the earth; and to protect
the earth itself. The products to which I now refer are
those not the property of individuals,&mdash;the birds, the beasts,
the fish, the vegetation. The bird sanctuaries now so well
accepted are good beginnings, as also the wild-flower preservation
societies, the nature-study groups, and many others;
but the individual is not yet sufficiently impressed with this
feeling in his own action.</p>

<p>To protect the earth is to save its fertility. This is the
fundamental conservation. Not all persons can participate
here, but every citizen can be mindful of the necessity of
it and aid in creating public sentiment. I wait for the coming
together of new organizations or societies that shall
have for their purpose the conservation of fertility. These
will be much more than agricultural and rural organizations,
and their work need not be technical or occupational. They
may include all persons, and the discussions and interests
may run the range of man's relation to land.</p>

<p>To leave his piece of earth more productive than when
he took it is the obligation of the good farmer, for there
are constantly more persons to be supported. In the large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
sense every one of us is a farmer, for the keeping of the
earth is given to the human race. We begin to understand
vaguely what relation the good keeping of the land bears to
national questions.</p>

<p>6. To keep the public health,&mdash;to protect it by keeping
one's body well, by taking care to commit no nuisance, to
contaminate no source of public infection, and to lend one's
self to participate in the correcting of abuses.</p>

<p>To be physically fit and uncomplaining is a public duty.
Maybe we shall find ways to demand physical training of
the people as effective as that afforded by military training
but without its sinister intentions.</p>

<p>Society will take over unto itself the oversight not only
of physical training and of providing that children shall be
well born but also more and more the oversight of the treatment
of disease, as a public necessity. We shall train the
sound to care for the unsound.</p>

<p>7. To come with personal succor as well as with money and
goods in time of flood and disaster, to visit the sick and the
afflicted, to relieve the poor and unfortunate. We shall learn
how to organize the vast resources in men and women who
are willing but do not know how, who are undiscovered and
untrained, yet who could be shaped into a great army of
assistance.</p>

<p>8. To respond promptly to the call of societies or groups
that act in the public interest; to participate in the many
neighborhood coöperations.</p></blockquote>

<p>As an illustration of the manner in which a
military equivalent may be determined, an illustration
has been taken from some agricultural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
activities. Before considering the military equivalent
in farm work it is necessary to give a brief
description of the basis upon which the Military
Training Commission will probably work in this
matter. The basis, in brief, is the "man work
unit" idea as developed by Dr. George F. Warren,
Professor of Farm Management, New York State
College of Agriculture.</p>

<p>A man work unit is the <i>average</i> amount of work
accomplished by a man in ten hours. A horse
work unit is the <i>average</i> amount of work accomplished
by a horse in ten hours. For New York
conditions, <i>an acre</i> of the following crops represents
the man and horse units indicated below.
In a majority of cases the numbers which follow
are based upon cost accounts. In some instances,
where data were limited, the results are more or
less an estimate.</p>

<p>In order to interpret the man-work-unit idea in
terms of the military requirements of New York
State that 16-year-, 17-year-, and 18-year-old boys are
to participate in such military training or as a partial
equivalent may offer farm experience or farm
training, it is necessary to translate the number
of hours required for such military instruction into
crop values or, to use the term already understood,
man work units.</p>

<p>Since there are 288 days or 41.1 weeks in the
required military-training period (September first to
the fifteenth day of June next ensuing), a boy must
drill 123.3 hours. This represents on the average

<p>Military equivalents as related to farm training
or farm experience appear to be much easier to
develop than those concerning mechanical training
and experience, especially where the work of 16-year-old
to 19-year-old boys is concerned.</p>

<p>At the present writing there seems to be on
the part of the public no very clear understanding
of the government's policy relative to exemption
for persons who are performing industrial and
farm service. If it is difficult to determine an exemption
policy for drafted men, it is very evident
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
that when boys of 16, 17, and 18 years of age have
become industrial drifters and have not decided
upon a vocational career, the determination of a
military-equivalent policy for them is a problem
much harder of solution.</p>

<p>Again, a study of boys' occupations reveals the fact
that only a very small proportion of those "above
the age of 16 years and not over the age of 19
years" who are at work in our cities are engaged
in occupations that will specifically prepare them
for service that has productive or defensive value.
Under the auspices of the Committee on Vocational
Help to Minors the Bureau of Attendance
of New York City made an extended survey, during
the summer of 1915, of 5000 children who
had left school between the ages of 14 and 16
and entered industry. Because of the vast amount
of labor involved in tabulating the data that were
collected, a random sampling was made of 150
boys and the same number of girls from each of
5 attendance districts. The 5 districts were selected
to represent as nearly as possible the general character
of the city. Each of these 1500 cases, 750
boys and 750 girls, was given a key number so
that when the information was tabulated it would
be possible to identify each case and verify the
information. Of the 750 boys 546 were within
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
the ages designated by this statute, 188 were
under 16 years of age and 16 of the boys were
19 years old.</p>

<p>Half of the boys were either errand-messengers,
clerks, or office boys. There were 213 in the
errand-messenger service, 107 clerks, and 55 office
boys. Another 100 were either stock boys, wagon
boys, or packers and wrappers. The largest trade
group was made up of 14 boys who were classed
as machinists' apprentices, and the second largest
trade group, that of electricians, had but 5 boys.</p>

<p>The departments in which these 750 boys were
working indicate the nature of the employment.
There were 265 in offices, 134 in the shop departments
of factories, 165 in shipping and delivery
departments, 92 in salesrooms, 35 in stock rooms,
31 in other departments, and 28 cases where the
investigator had failed to secure this information.</p>

<p>A careful study of the work done by each of
the 750 boys resulted in the selection of 32 who
seemed to be doing work that might give them the
specific training indicated as essential. The result
of this study can be summarized under the headings
of the trades the boys were learning.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Blacksmith.</i> The one boy apprenticed to this trade had
been working in the shop for seventeen months, was
earning $13 a week, and was perfectly satisfied with his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
work. So he was likely to continue until he learned
the trade.</p>

<p><i>Brass worker.</i> Of the two boys of this group, one had
served twelve months and the other twenty-four months
at the trade. They earned respectively $5 and $6.50 a
week and both intended to remain at the trade until it
was learned.</p>

<p><i>Carpenter.</i> There were two boys serving as carpenter's
helpers. With one it was simply a temporary position.
The other had been working at the trade for a year, and
although he was receiving but $4 a week, he intended to
remain at the trade.</p>

<p><i>Electrician.</i> Three of the five boys working at this
trade had been employed for over eighteen months as
electricians' helpers. The other two had had four months
and two months respectively of such experience. The
five all expressed a determination to remain long enough
to learn the trade.</p>

<p><i>Ship fitter.</i> The one boy in this group, although out of
school over a year, had been working at the navy yard
but two months.</p>

<p><i>Locksmith.</i> With only ten days' experience this boy
was ready to quit.</p>

<p><i>Machinist.</i> The average time spent by the 14 boys
classified as machinists was less than three and one-half
months, and not one of the group had worked as long as
a year. Three were running drill presses, 1 was cleaning
the wheels and pipes of a feather-bone machine, 2
were not employed. Most of these were dissatisfied and
looking for other work. A boy who had been working
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
eleven months on a screwing machine, 1 who had worked
nine months repairing autos, and 1 who had worked eight
months as a machinist's helper&mdash;3 out of the 14&mdash;had
worked long enough at the trade to know that they liked
it, and expressed the intention of learning the trade.</p>

<p><i>Plumber.</i> Three of the four boys classified as plumbers'
helpers had worked over a year and a half at the trade,
liked the work, and expected to follow it. The fourth boy
was using it as a temporary job.</p>

<p><i>Solderer.</i> The one boy in this line was dissatisfied with
the job and with his pay.</p>

<p><i>Sheet-metal worker.</i> The one boy serving as a tin-roofer's
helper had worked for the firm for a year and was perfectly
satisfied with all conditions.</p></blockquote>

<p>There seem to be 14 of the 750 boys who had
been working long enough at a trade and were
sufficiently pleased with the prospects for the
future to make one safe in saying that they
would probably complete their apprenticeship&mdash;although
this conclusion may not be justified.
These 14 were distributed as follows:</p>

<p>This study of Mr. Chatfield's shows that not
only were very few of the boys between the ages
of 16 and 19 receiving vocational experience that
would train them to be useful to the state in the
maintenance of defense or in the other interests
of the state as outlined in the bill, but also boys
of these ages are likely to change their work rather
frequently. There were 184 of these 750 boys
who had been out of school between three and
four years when this study was made. Of these
184 boys 41 were still working at the job they
first had when they left school, 47 were on the
second job, 41 were on the third job, and 13 had
made eight or more changes.</p>

<p>I know of no study which more clearly points out
the "blind alleyness" of the employment of children.
However, some of us, including Dr. David
Snedden of Columbia University, feel that a better
term than "blind-alley occupations" would be
"occupations involving juvenile employment." To
us the evil of errand-messenger, clerk, or office-boy
service is not that boys wander into or are thrust
into a line of work which may be a blind alley, but
rather that <i>no provision is made in the public-school
system for giving the boys a short preparatory
training helpful to them in this temporary service,
and that no training which would help them to get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
out of such work is given them in the office, store,
or factory</i>. If society would frankly recognize that
there are juvenile employments and that boys might
well work in them while they are juveniles and yet
be trained through such work, and apart from such
work in continuation schools, to discover themselves
and to prepare themselves for other work, we might
develop a constructive educational program.</p>

<p>This study certainly shows the waste of the boy
power of the state and proves conclusively that
there is need for the state to grapple consciously
with the problem of conserving its youth; and
when one reads this summary of an accurate and
previously unpublished report, one is led to believe
that William James, John Dewey, Liberty Hyde
Bailey, and John Finley are right in their contention
that there should be a mobilization of the boy
force of the state looking toward conservation of
the boy power that it may lead into training for
skilled work, into citizenship, into sturdy health,
and into right living.

<small>RED CROSS AND OTHER COMMUNITY WORK</small></h2>

<p>Thoughtful people are becoming disposed to
criticize the present methods employed in many
of our sewing, cooking, and millinery classes. It
is felt that the girls in these classes, through the
work which they do, think of themselves first, last,
and all the time. They spend time on embroidery
to cater further to decorative instincts long established
by custom without much thought as to
artistic values. They spend half a year making
graduation dresses which they may wear before
admiring parents. They copy the latest fashion
in hats without thought as to utility or beauty.
They knit feathery neck pieces and neglect stocking
darning. They laboriously sew by hand articles
which had better be made on a machine.</p>

<p>Our girls must learn to think of others than
themselves. Their sewing and millinery must get
away from the individual-problem idea. Of course
girls must learn to sew by hand, especially when
the home in these days teaches so little in the way
of hand sewing. But after they have learned to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
sew by hand, they should not continue to use
hand sewing on work that should be done on a
sewing machine. Of course it is wise to train
girls to make some of their own clothing, but to
make this clothing without regard to study of textiles
or adaptation to personal needs or the eternal
fitness of things is not in accord with the educational
purpose of our schools, which is to train
personal character as well as to develop skill in
domestic arts. When the family hosiery needs
darning, and the small children of the family need
clothes, and the schoolgirl needs a middy blouse
or a school uniform, it is unwise to spend so
much energy on continuing a type of domestic
art which lacks the socialized appeal necessary
to conform with modern social needs and modern
industrial methods.</p>

<p>The teachers of household arts are beginning
to see the need for reform. Many are bringing
into the school life such problems as the mending
and darning of the family clothes; cooking school
luncheons; managing day nurseries for babies of
working mothers; making table and bed linen for
hospitals; making jams and jellies for charitable
societies. Such teachers have welcomed the opportunity
offered by the present war to forward the
new idea of socializing domestic-arts work. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
have been impatient of the dilettante work which
they formerly did when their girls practically
wasted hours of school time in making things
which could be bought for less than the cost of
materials, to say nothing about the cost of time
of the girls themselves, who are in school but a
few years at best&mdash;years when they should be receiving
instruction in subjects which have real
training values. These progressive teachers have
desired that their girls develop more speed; that
they receive training helpful in meeting the actual
trade conditions in dressmaking and millinery
shops; that they learn to work together on some
common problem which all may see is worth while
and for a purpose which is larger than themselves.
Red Cross work has given these teachers the opportunity
which they sought. They believe that
the Red Cross work during the war may easily be
converted into community work after the war is
over. Hospitals, charity organizations, orphan asylums,
and homes are always with us. The great
appeal now, obviously, is Red Cross work. The
permanent appeal is always the need of the home
and the community.</p>

<p>An activity which has been very general throughout
the country, as well as in France and England,
has been the voluntary contribution of the work of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
women's organizations to the Red Cross Society.
The making of hospital supplies belongs more
peculiarly to women than do many forms of war
work, and it is easily incorporated into the sewing
courses of our elementary and secondary schools.
A feature that makes it especially adaptable to
schools is the standardization by the present business
manager, under whose direction blue prints,
photographs, and written and pictured specifications
have been prepared.</p>

<p>Those of us who are interested in the methods
employed in vocational schools to turn out standard
products appreciate the benefit to the girl of learning
to work from well-planned directions and of turning
out a product exactly corresponding to specifications.
It is believed that this manner of doing
the work holds an educational value which entitles
it to a place in the sewing course of every school.
Both technique and speed elements are necessary
for the condition of need which the Red Cross is
meeting. As pupils are called upon to respond to
this demand for quantities of garments and hospital
supplies, as well as for accurately made articles,
they will become trained in speed and accuracy
while rendering a distinct service to their country.</p>

<p>In the state of New York about 3000 girls in
sewing classes began work for the Red Cross on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
March 1, 1917, under the direction of Anna Hedges
Talbot, state specialist in girls' vocational work;
the work being done voluntarily by both schools
and pupils. To obtain materials, arrangements
were first made with local Red Cross chapters;
but in many places the lack of a chapter or its
lack of funds prevented the coöperation with the
schools, and material was supplied by liberal contributions
from women's clubs, which realized the
necessity of making use of the offer of the girls'
services, thus causing more work to be turned
into Red Cross channels than would have been
possible without this financial aid. In organizing
the work the various localities sent an authorized
school person, generally the teacher of household
arts, to confer with the Red Cross people as to
what articles were needed and how they should
be made, and to bring back to the school written
specifications, paper patterns, and models. In many
places the teachers took a course of instruction
under some Red Cross nurse specifically qualified
to give sewing instruction.</p>

<p>In this careful way the schools proceeded, and
within six weeks returned reports to the State
Education Department showing that every kind of
article which was needed, from the simplest surgical
dressings to the most carefully finished surgeon's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
gown, had been made by about 3000 girls working
on an average of one or two hours a week during
their regular school time. That none of this work
had to be ripped or done over when it reached the
Red Cross headquarters reflects credit on both
girls and instructors.</p>

<p>One comparatively small sewing class in the
vocational school at Mount Vernon, New York,
filled a box for the Belgian Relief, according to
Red Cross specifications, as follows:</p>

<table summary=" ">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">18</td>

<p>All the schools of the state inquired if they
might go on with this work when the schools
opened in September. Schools which were not able
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
to do the work in the spring were ready to begin
on the first day of school in the fall. The work,
however, has hitherto been neglected except in
the curriculum of schools which have vocational
courses, so that only girls electing domestic arts
have had the opportunity of doing it as a part of
their school program, but there is no reason why
it should be limited to these girls. Those who are
taking academic courses in high schools&mdash;and
they greatly outnumber the vocational students&mdash;should
have a chance to render service through
the schools. In this connection it is well to say that
the burden of doing productive work in war service
should not be limited entirely to students in vocational
courses. It will be a mistake to throw the
burden of useful service upon a special group and
in this way help develop the notion that those
who take classical courses have nothing to do but
look on, while those in vocational courses are to
do the work.</p>

<p>Voluntary after-school clubs were organized in
a great many schools, but no voluntary work can
be systematized or directed so well as courses
incorporated in the curriculum, and it is suggested
to the schools of the country that special Red Cross
courses be offered and that all girls be expected
to devote a few hours a week to the work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>The following quotation from Édouard Petit's
book "De l' école à la guerre" on what the normal
schools of France are doing ought to be enough
to inspire our American girls.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The girls of the normal schools of France are working
very hard, knitting, sewing, making hospital supplies, in
the intervals of their school work; also acting as laundresses,
secretaries, bookkeepers, etc. They are not old
enough to be nurses. In addition to the work for the
armies, they give a part of their time to work for other
students. They are providing for the girl students of the
normal schools in the invaded districts, many of whom
were obliged to make long journeys on foot, clad in summer
clothes, with no chance to carry even a change of
clothing with them. The school at Fontenay appealed to
the normal schools for aid for its students; other appeals
followed, some from schools in the districts from which
the invaders were driven out. Very soon in all the normal
schools of France girls were cutting and sewing, providing
new garments, or garments from their own supply, to be
sent to the towns in the north of France. Some of these
supplies are held in reserve for the towns that are still to
be liberated. One teacher writes: "Our young girls are
glad to come to the aid of their fellow students who are not
known to them but who are coming to seem nearer as I
have them learn about the schools, read the letters that are
received, etc. Anything which makes real and tangible the
responsibility of this friendly help ought to be encouraged."</p>

<p>As the need arises, our secondary-school girls will respond
in like manner.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>The preparation needed to initiate Red Cross
work in any large way in the schools of a state
is considerable. There is a good deal of organization
and consequent detail connected with it.
The domestic-arts teachers of a school district or
county ought to be called together and instructed
in the minutiæ of garment-making and surgical
dressings. With the blue prints, photographs, and
written specifications already issued by the Red
Cross headquarters at Washington these teachers
could then work out a full set of directions for
each article which would be specific and graphic.
These could be printed by the state printer or,
better, by the boys in a vocational school. In
addition, moving-picture reels of processes carried
on according to the most modern methods of
workroom procedure could be shown to those who
have not been in contact with present-day modes
of work.</p>

<p>In order to excite interest on the part of the
community in rural districts where this work has
not as yet penetrated to any extent, moving pictures
of processes of making surgical dressings,
pajamas, surgeons' gowns, or children's dresses
could be exhibited as illustrating what other sections
of the state are already doing. These moving
pictures could be taken of girls at work in an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
up-to-date New York City factory, and the reels
could be either purchased outright or rented from
an educational-film company. In Washington the
Department of the Interior has a number of reels
which have been put at the disposal of the Red
Cross, and will make more if the occasion demands.
Slides too could be made showing special operations,
special garments, and special methods of
arranging work. When public interest has been
aroused at a public meeting in a small center, the
school will find it easy to take up the work and
push it forward. The person in charge of the work
would have to keep in constant touch with the
Red Cross headquarters as to the needs for garments
and hospital supplies, as well as to the
changes that from time to time have to be made
in the kind and quality of supplies. A chart could
be made of the capacity as to equipment and number
of pupils, and the present grade of their working
ability, for each place where a school is located.
Brief reports could be sent to a state director from
these schools as to what they could make, when
they could make it, and when specified articles
could be finished. Thus there would be a line
out from a central supervisor to each school in
the state where pupils are old enough to do any
work of this public-service nature. Along this line
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
would travel the information as to what was being
done and what would be the next thing to be done.</p>

<p>Knitting by hand is one of the occupations
which many girls and women are taking up.
One drawback to hand-knitting is that it takes
a good deal of time, and in the case of socks,
at least, the results of amateur work may be
uncomfortable to the wearer. It is suggested that
schools put in knitting machines. One school at
Yonkers, New York, has such a machine. It enables
its operator to finish a sock every twenty minutes,
or 12 pairs in an eight-hour day. It is possible
to knit wristlets and sleeveless sweaters on these
machines. The Vacation War Relief Committee
of New York City has been responsible for the
sale of 980 of these machines, on which over 85,000
pairs of socks have been made during the past year.</p>

<p>A letter written to me by Mettie B. Hills, Director
of Girls' Work in Troy, New York, relative to her
Red Cross work is so full of human interest and
gives in such detail the excellent methods which
she employed that I quote it in full. It will serve as
suggestive material for other equally enthusiastic
and competent teachers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My office has been turned into a cutting room. Girls
are now at a large table cutting hospital bed shirts with
just as little waste as possible. Smaller girls are snipping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the few waste pieces, and one little girl at the end of the
table is filling a fracture pillow with the snips. In my
machine-sewing room the girls are making hospital bed
shirts. Each girl has a different operation. The shirts
move through the cutting room to this room and from
one machine to the next just as they do in a factory. They
finally reach the inspection table, where they are inspected
as they are folded, and an inspection card is placed in the
pocket. They are then piled up for that final inspection
which I give every article before it goes to our stock room.
Here we hold all articles until we have enough to make
the moving worth while, and then they are taken to
Red Cross headquarters in the city truck. The chairmen
of each Red Cross division of our local chapter are notified
beforehand that things are coming and they are at headquarters
to receive our work and sign for it. I tell you,
it is a big day for all when the school work is turned in.
I hear about it for weeks afterward.</p>

<p>The girls do not stay at one operation. As soon as they
are ready, they are promoted to the next. [And in this connection
may I call the reader's attention to the chapter which
brought out the new spirit of teaching the household arts?]</p>

<p>The little jacket which is hanging in my clothespress is
only the beginning of a big piece of work which I expect
to push during the winter, a piece of work which I believe
will do more to standardize the girls' work than anything
we have yet done.</p>

<p>Another room is given over to knitting, and the girls
pass from one type of work to another. We have a teacher
from the Red Cross rooms who is showing the older girls
how to make oakum pads. The work is really fascinating,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
and fortunately we no longer have to think of the money
for the materials, as the work done in the schools has been
of so much higher standard that the local chapter has voted
me $500 in order that there might be no danger of our
stopping the work. I am inclosing a list of what our schools
have done in the past three months.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course the Red Cross work need not be
limited to girls and women. Boys under 14 are
able to pick over oakum and to do other work that
girls of the same age can do. The older boys
can adjust and tend the knitting machines and
pack and deliver the finished product.</p>

<p>Men and women in many of the state institutions
will be glad to contribute a share in service.
Thomas Mott Osborne, while warden at Sing Sing,
organized through the Mutual Welfare League a
large class of men who enthusiastically gave up
their evening periods of recreation in order that
they might knit for soldiers in foreign fields.</p>

<p>A number of young boys, none over 14, from
Troy and Albany orphan asylums were taken in
auto trucks 30 miles into the country to a currant-producing
section, where they picked 5000 quarts
of currants which had been donated to the county
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
Red Cross organization. These currants were
shipped in a refrigerator car 90 miles down the
river to Yonkers, New York, where the girls made
them into jelly and currant juice, the sugar being
donated by a local refinery.</p>

<p>Possibly the largest service that boys can render
will be the making of Red Cross splints. As has
already been stated in another chapter the Canadian
schoolboys are doing a great deal of this
work in connection with their manual training.
An article in a recent issue of the <i>Manual Training
Magazine</i> describes in detail the work of the
manual-training centers of British Columbia. These
splints are made merely for first aid, and are used
where it is not necessary that they conform exactly
to the contour of the limbs or body. They are
padded a little with cotton or cloth and fitted on
the injured part of the soldier.</p>

<p>A general conception prevails that Red Cross
work is limited to battle-field relief, but it must
be remembered that this organization also carries
on civilian relief. It is very likely, as time goes
on, that the schools will come to realize that there
is probably no better agency than the Red Cross
with which they can associate themselves in allaying
the suffering and relieving the distress in the
community. It must be remembered that the Red
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
Cross is splendidly organized, with its great central
headquarters at Washington, its division headquarters
in larger groups of states, and its local
chapters in every county. There is no activity of
the Red Cross which a child cannot duplicate in its
own sphere of life, and the American school may
well become a center of interest in Red Cross work
in time of war. One of the departments already
organized is that of Home Service, which exists
to help families maintain their standards of living.
School-service work under a Junior Red Cross has
been organized in order to bring the schools into
direct touch with the work. The schools can give
lessons in first aid, elementary hygiene, and home
care of the sick, in home dietetics, and in the
preparation of surgical dressings. It can make
the necessary supplies for local soldiers who are
in mobilization camps. It can make supplies for
the soldiers' families, especially during the winter
months. It can raise money by means of entertainments
of an educational nature, and here opportunities
are often presented to correlate the
work with history and English. In short, during
the stress of war, with its rising cost of food, its
industrial changes, its uncertainties in living conditions,
with the home often handicapped by the
withdrawal of the chief wage earner, there will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
an excellent opportunity for the school to come in
with its aid. The diet of the family, both in quality
and variety, may be improved through the helpful
advice of the teacher of home economics; children
who are in need of medical care may be sent to
the dispensary. The Home Service Department
suggests that teachers may do helpful vocational-guidance
work; for in the absence of father and
older brothers many a boy and girl can be helped
by a teacher's encouragement to go into occupations
where there is a future, where skill can be acquired,
and where there is a chance for advancement.</p>

<p>The following quotation from the London <i>Times</i>
of some Red Cross work in France pointedly illustrates
what home and school service in the Red
Cross movement may mean in America.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The most detailed enumeration would hardly exhaust the
activities of education in the common cause&mdash;voluntary
contributions to the national funds deducted from the salaries
of teachers; liberal subscriptions from pupils; participation
in the collection of gold; the dispatch of packets to
soldiers, and of books to the children of reconquered Alsace;
help given to orphans whom a school or class has taken
under its charge; manual labor on behalf of soldiers at the
front, the wounded, the lame, and prisoners; material or
moral assistance to refugees; a welcome given to all abandoned
children, Belgian or French, in the families of
masters or of friends of the school; correspondence with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
soldiers at the front, wounded, and prisoners; attendance at
the funeral of soldiers who have died of their wounds; the
public reception by schools, <i>lycées</i>, and universities of colleagues
or old pupils wounded, promoted, or quoted in dispatches;
befriending soldiers who have no family to look
after them; the institution of workrooms for men and women
who are out of work; participation in the celebration of Belgian
Day, the Serbian Day, the French Day, the Day of the
75, the Day of the Orphans, and so on,&mdash;tasks which will
have to be continued during the coming school year, because
the need for them will still be present, and doubtless, for
some of them at least, during the years immediately after
the war, when the school will still have before it a splendid
opportunity for social service.</p></blockquote>

<p>President Wilson has honored the school children
of our country by a proclamation dated September
18, 1917, in which he calls upon them to do their
part in the war by joining the Junior Red Cross,
thus assisting in the mercy work of the senior
organization. A portion of his message is quoted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The school is the natural center of your life. Through it
you can best work in the great cause of freedom to which
we have all pledged ourselves.</p>

<p>Our Junior Red Cross will bring to you opportunities of
service to your community and to other communities all
over the world, and guide your service with high and religious
ideals. It will teach you how to save in order that
suffering children elsewhere may have the chance to live.
It will teach you how to prepare some of the supplies which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
wounded soldiers and homeless families lack. It will send
to you through the Red Cross bulletins the thrilling stories
of relief and rescue. And, best of all, more perfectly than
through any of your other school lessons, you will learn by
doing those kind things under your teacher's direction to
be the future good citizens of this great country which we
all love.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our President is a master of good pedagogy as
well as a leader of men, and he expresses the very
best in modern educational thought. He tells the
children to think of their school as the natural center
of their lives; to serve the community in which
they live; to reach out through service and study
to the larger world outside; to have behind all
action high ideals; to save that others less fortunate
may have; to learn how to do and through
doing how to grow; to learn directly of the world
of action while it is in action; to work with their
elders for a common purpose,&mdash;the common purpose
of being useful citizens of our great country.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>REËDUCATION OF THE DISABLED</small></h2>

<p>In all probability not one person in a hundred
ever heard the word "reëducation" before reading
the very recent newspaper accounts of the government's
plans as announced by Surgeon-general
Gorgas for rehabilitating and reëducating the disabled
soldiers. We have been in the habit of seeing
blinded and crippled men selling lead pencils at
street corners, and we have given our pity and our
penny. We have seen the wonderful rugs woven
by the blind (assisted in the designing and setting
up by people who could see), and we have bought
them, impelled by a sympathetic interest in a
charitable cause. We have heard some exceptional
person, who has overcome tremendous physical disabilities,
describe her methods of studying college
subjects and competing successfully with those
who are unhandicapped, and we have said "How
wonderful!" and stopped thinking at that point.</p>

<p>As a nation we have failed in our duty to make
the physically handicapped economically self-supporting
and normally strong. It is an educational
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
problem as great as, if not greater than, that of
assisting the mental defective.</p>

<p>Only within two years have the vocational schools
of our country even thought of instructing their
pupils in the general principles of safety. Only
since workingmen's compensation laws and industrial
insurance have come into the foreground in
legislative halls have public men considered the
appalling need for "safety-first" instruction in factories
and in technical schools.</p>

<p>For the duration of the war our thought of safety
appliances for industrial life in peaceful times sinks
into the background, and we think only of devices
for preventing suffocation by poisonous gases, of
means of withstanding liquid fire, of deflectors for
bullets and camouflage for marching troops. But
notwithstanding all these precautions, the inevitable
results of war are before us.</p>

<p>The multitude of men who have been injured
in the present war is out of all proportion to the
number injured in any war with which history or
experience makes us acquainted, and the fitting of
them to be economically self-supporting is a task
of stupendous proportions. For the problem of the
support of these men cannot be met entirely by pensions;
even if this were possible, the man would thus
become a dead weight for the rest of the country
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
to carry, an unenviable position from all points
of view. In the case of the professional man, he
may, even if handicapped, carry on his work; but
the man with a trade, when maimed or blinded,
must be taught some other vocation or be provided
with some mechanical substitute for his loss in legs
or arms and often with special tools and other
apparatus which will enable him to carry on his former
occupation or a new one. It will not be possible
to place all these men as ticket sellers, news vendors,
gatemen, and in other positions hitherto appropriate
for the industrially disabled; and our vocational
schools, the medical profession, and the national
government must coöperate in a study of the
reëducation of injured soldiers with the aim of
putting them on the pay roll.</p>

<p>On July 31, 1917, announcement was made
through the press of the United States that a
government system for the rehabilitation and reëducation
of men disabled in the fighting abroad would
be made an adjunct of the proposed scheme for
the federal insurance of soldiers and sailors, and
that the plans for the rehabilitation of these men
would probably, like those in Canada, be modeled
after the systems in use in France and England.
It is, of course, part of the government's duty to
provide for the future of men crippled in its service.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
It is not the province of the several philanthropic
agencies which in the past have commendably
endeavored to care for the blind and the crippled
by teaching them the handiworks of weaving, brush-making,
etc. The work must be done on a sound
and scientific basis, and be adjusted to economic
conditions on a vast scale such as no philanthropic
society can hope to maintain; that is, it must not
be relief work, it must be governmental constructive
work in reëducation which shall teach the disabled
man how to overcome the disadvantage of
his infirmity in reëntering the industrial world.</p>

<p>To learn the extent of what may be done in this
work of rehabilitation, England, Canada, and the
United States look to France,&mdash;to the municipal
vocational-training school for soldiers at Lyons
known as L'École Joffre and the many schools
patterned after it in other cities; to the Institution
of St. Maurice, at Paris, which has been established
by the French government to be a model
for other institutions; to the Laboratory of Research
on Vocational Work, in Paris, directed by Dr. Jules
Amar; and to the Anglo-Belgian hospitals, especially
that at Vernon. It has been announced that the
United States will pattern its training school after
the Institution of St. Maurice, which is a clearing
house of experiments and research for the continent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>There are also in France, as in England and
Canada, convalescent homes for disabled soldiers,&mdash;many
of which are supported by private benevolence,&mdash;where
trades are taught. At the Institute
of Les Amis des Soldats Aveugles, in the suburbs
of Paris, the blind soldiers are taught the trades of
basket-making, bootmaking, brush-making, netting,
harness-making, and bookbinding, the course taking
about six months before the pupils become proficient.
The institution runs its own printing establishment
for literature in Braille (the print for the
blind). The blind are peculiarly incapacitated, and
the occupations open to them are consequently
limited. Private benevolence has done much to
lessen their economic misfortune, and the government
must do more. Some French doctors believe
that tobacco manufacturing and matchmaking are
adapted to the blind because of their well-known
delicacy of touch; many hospitals are giving them
lessons in the art of massage, for the same reason,
believing that the blind man can qualify for this
employment in a few months. The work, however,
is still in the experimental stage. But the
most progressive work in France has been done
in the municipal and government training schools
in equipping the maimed and crippled for work,
and it is this of which this chapter will treat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>The government institution of St. Maurice follows
the lead of the now famous L'École Joffre,
which in turn learned much from a school at
Charleroi, maintained before the war for victims
of industrial accidents. L'École Joffre was the pioneer
which has blazed the way for the technical instruction
of the wounded. It was founded under
the direction of the city of Lyons, with the mayor
of the city, Edouard Herriot, most active in the
undertaking, and Maurice Barrès to spread its
fame with winged words. To house it, an old
disused château in a populous part of the city
was put in order late in 1914, and early in 1915
the men discharged from the hospital and pronounced
suitable for training entered upon their
course of instruction. The first one hundred
cases received were restricted to those disabled
but cured of wounds, the partially paralyzed, and
those recovered from amputation. To direct the
technical work, Monsieur Basèque, a professor in
the industrial-accident school at Charleroi, was
chosen. The success of the school was immediate,
and by September another was opened in the
outskirts of the city to accommodate 80 men.</p>

<p>Naturally, at first, experiments were made, and
the experience of L'École Joffre is most valuable
to us. Three schemes were inaugurated: one,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
called <i>placement à domicile</i>, where an allowance
was made the man, who was to live in his own
home while he entered a workshop to learn a
craft of some sort; another, <i>la mode de l'externat</i>,
where the man pupil lived at his home or in
lodgings while attending classes daily, receiving
at the school at noon a canteen meal in order to
save the time which would otherwise be taken in
going home; and a third, <i>le régime de l'internat</i>,
where he lived in the institution as a pupil in a
boarding school. Experience developed that this
last method was the only one which might be
adopted with any assurance of success, the others
subjecting the men to possible discouragement,
through the jealousy shown by other shop workers,
the necessarily slow progress, the inequality of pay,
the varying degrees of instruction, and insufficient
supervision. Canada too, after investigation, has
found that the men throughout their training must
live at the school and be under supervision, in
order to avoid discouragement and the forming of
bad habits of idleness and alcoholism, and to insure
continuity of interest in their work.</p>

<p>The condition of entrance to L'École Joffre
in Lyons is that the man must be pronounced
permanently unfit for military service. Next he
is examined to ascertain his fitness for industrial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
work, a matter determined by his freedom from disease,
his previous work, his general education and
ability, the employment preferred, and the occupations
open. Whenever possible, the man is kept
in his former employment. This principle is sound
economically and psychologically, and must be
adhered to in our schools. The employments for
which training is given are bookkeeping, shorthand
and typewriting, paper-stitching, bookbinding,
toymaking, shoemaking, woodworking and drafting,
tailoring, wood carving, gardening, and machine
adjusting. Office work offers special opportunity
to the one-handed and the crippled, as stenography
and typewriting do to the blind. The course with
commercial subjects, it was found, had to be carefully
restricted, for many without sufficient education
wished to take it up, and there was danger of
sending too many men into occupations already
well supplied with competent workers.</p>

<p>L'École Joffre is a municipal undertaking, a
free school, the men pupils paying no board or
tuition. It is in a measure subsidized, for the
school receives from the Ministry of War a grant
of 3 francs 50 centimes for each pupil for each
day's attendance. The other funds to support the
school are provided in various ways&mdash;popular subscriptions
and grants by provincial organizations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
and other official bodies. As for the men themselves,
they do not, while in training, receive the
government pension of 1 franc 70 centimes a day,
but the school makes each man an allowance of
1 franc 25 centimes a day from its own funds, so
far as they permit of such liberality.</p>

<p>The work done by the city of Lyons has been
followed in many localities,&mdash;Bourges, Bordeaux,
Marseille, Rouen, and others, in most cases
endowed by the municipalities. At Bourges additional
classes are held in silver-engraving, hair-dressing,
and locksmith work.</p>

<p>In the similar school in Marseille, tinsmiths,
foundry workers, jewelers, and metal workers are
trained. At Cluses, in 1915, seventy partially disabled
men were serving an apprenticeship in
clock-making. This is sitting work, but it demands
the possession of one hand and at least two fingers
on the other, and an exceptionally good eye,
so it is not so generally taught as other trades.
At Cluny a course of training has been established
for the former workmen who wish to become master
workmen and designers; that is, the school
specializes in training those whose ability is above
the average.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that in French provinces
there are many more hand processes in use than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
in the United States. Joinery and carpentry, for
example, employ tools to make parts which in
this country are turned out in factories. The
industrial difference is evident in some of the
photographs of the rehabilitated French workmen
who are shown ingeniously at work with artificial
"hands and arms" on processes for which there
is no field here. Many French soldiers, too, find
employment in toy making, a real industry for
France and Germany, but one which is unlikely
to be developed here to any extent. In America
we must fit our disabled men to tend machines,
and not make the blunder of preparing men for
operations which are out of date in our standardized
machine industries. In a very moving little
book, "Les jeunes filles françaises et la guerre"
(Jules Combarieu, Paris, 1916), we read of a man
who was employed in a joinery establishment after
suffering the amputation of both hands. His left
arm was furnished with a leather glove to which
was adapted an ingenious instrument for holding
nails. His right arm was fitted with another
glove arrangement to which a hammer was attached.
With the left he took the nails; and
with the right he pounded them into a piece of
wood. Marvelous as the achievement may be, in
America this workman would belong to the class
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
for whom special relief workshops must be maintained.
Work in reëducation must naturally be
adapted to the demands of the vicinity; the
French towns of Nancy, Clermont, and Montpellier
have not the industrial conditions of Pittsburgh,
Worcester, or Birmingham.</p>

<p>In Paris the model government institution of
St. Maurice contains both a convalescent hospital
and a training school for discharged patients. It
has the advantage over L'École Joffre of uniting
hospital and school, giving an opportunity of combining
physical with industrial reëducation. It is
therefore possible to have at St. Maurice, under
the direction of Dr. Bourillon, physiotherapy by
massage, electricity, medical gymnastics, and mechanotherapy,
which prepare the man for his reëducation.
Dr. Bourillon affirms that this preliminary
medical care reduces the effort which the patient
must make to learn and exercise a trade.</p>

<p>The French government also maintains at Paris
the Laboratoire des Recherches sur le Travail Professionel,&mdash;an
establishment for the scientific examination
of wounded men, particularly to ascertain
the percentage of their disability in the labor market.
The question of how many disabled men are
capable of reëducation is one not rigidly determined.
There are, of course, some hopeless cases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
which will have to be entirely dependent on the
government for their support, whether by pension
or other means under discussion. But the figures
of Dr. Jules Amar, director of this laboratory of
industrial research, a man who has devised mechanical
apparatus for developing the capacities of
injured limbs, show that of the maimed cases which
have come under his observation at least 80 per
cent are capable of vocational reëducation. Of this
proportion 45 per cent succeed in earning normal
salaries after a training including some specializing;
20 per cent are partially restored to normal
wage earning; while the remaining 15 per cent
can only obtain work in shops maintained especially
for the disabled, such as a toymaking studio.
Of the reëducation of this 80 per cent Dr. Amar
says: "It is a question of science and method; it
demands the organization of training schools....
It unites medical and technical knowledge to the
end that artificial limbs shall be adapted to satisfy
physical and vocational capabilities. The proportion
of men dependent upon relief is then reduced;
and one must endeavor, without ceasing,
to diminish it."<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>The method in the Paris schools is scientific.
"In the training schools," he continues, "the object
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
of the instruction is to supplement the diminished
physical capacity of the disabled man with a
greater knowledge of his trade, superior technical
instruction, or better vocational adjustment."</p>

<p>The first responsibility falls on the medical examiner.
To reëquip the maimed physically, an
indispensable prosthesis (an addition of an artificial
part to supply the missing member of the body)
is made, the <i>dynamical</i> prosthesis&mdash;not the kind
which <i>replaces</i> the member, but that which reëstablishes
or repairs the <i>functions</i>. What the wounded
man needs is not an admirable imitation of the
missing arm or leg, ingenious and often fragile
appliances, but a practical working tool,&mdash;a socket
into which a variety of tools can be fitted.</p>

<p>Next, in the laboratory of the school an analysis
of the workman's movements is made in relation
to their regularity, direction, speed, and according
to the force they expend. The measure of the
man's physical incapacity is deduced from impressions
gathered in this analysis, and from it the
method of training must be devised. Furnished
with his card of qualifications, the man passes from
the hospital laboratory to the workshop, where experts
instruct him in theory and practice. The first
thing to determine is whether a man cannot perform
the operations of his former trade. In many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
cases a man imagines that the disability caused by
amputation of fingers, hand, or arm makes him
unfit for the work he did previous to the war.
But where the school is attached to a hospital
and the man's disability can be accurately known,
the union of medical skill and technical instruction
makes it possible to restore him to usefulness
with the minimum of effort and waste.</p>

<p>Dr. Amar recommends for special relief work
for the 15 per cent who are not capable of any
great degree of reëducation, shops which will execute
orders for easily manufactured articles, involving
such processes as light cooperage, stamping,
plaiting, toymaking,&mdash;work such as is offered at
the shop in Rue de la Durance, Paris.</p>

<p>Another institution whose methods are similar
to those employed at St. Maurice and by Dr. Amar
is the Anglo-Belgian Military Institute, at Port
Villez, Vernon, under the technical director Major
Haccourt. It accommodates over 800 men, and is
self-supporting, the land where it is situated having
been originally covered with forests, the sale
of which financed the undertaking at first. Forty-three
trades are taught here, and a large farm is
maintained on which horses wounded in war are
cared for and made useful. The workshops provide
for commercial courses, telegraphy, wall-paper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
designing, the manufacture of motor vehicles and
electrical machinery of all kinds, plumbing and
tinsmithing, rabbit and poultry farming, fur curing
and dyeing, etc. The shops make fuse boxes for
munitions, and various army supplies. At Vernon
the men pupils are regarded as still in the Belgian
army, receiving military pay; they have no option
as to entrance, since they are under military discipline,
but enter as soon as they are discharged
from the Anglo-Belgian hospital at Rouen. In this
school the services of the best professors in different
trades are obtained without trouble, for the director
can requisition any man in the Belgian army for
any required purpose. Before the war Belgium had
a large proportion of highly trained workmen; and
with compulsory reëducation and military discipline
the operation of this institution is much simplified.</p>

<p>In working out plans for reëducation in the
United States we must have in mind certain principles.
There is the necessity of making our training
thorough. Our problem will be not to find
employment for the period of the war, during which
there is a constant demand for workers, but to train
the disabled for an occupation in which they can
hold a place after the temporary shortage of labor
created by the war conditions is over. It is obvious
that if the men are incompetent and ill-prepared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
for their work, they will be weeded out as soon
as skilled men are available. Their work is barred
from that demanding manual strength; nor can it
hope to belong to that highly specialized kind
which would demand an arduous and elaborate
training. But there is a wide range of semiskilled
occupations where a handicapped man can earn
more than if he should enter after a long course
of training the highly skilled trade where he would
meet the competition of the physically normal.</p>

<p>There are at least three kinds of disabilities our
schools will have to deal with. First, there is the
man who has lost his right arm. This man must,
whenever possible, be taught to use his left hand in
his trade, although it is sometimes easier to learn
a new process than to change right-hand to left-hand
methods in the old operation. In carpentry,
turning, and machine trades, however, the one-armed
man may continue to be employed, and
our vocational schools should incorporate courses
in left-hand training. Here also we find another
need: there must be built for the disabled <i>left-hand
machines</i>.</p>

<p>Next there is the case of the man who must be
instructed in an allied trade because his former one
is pronounced by medical examination and the
tests of mechanotherapy to be impossible. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
last there is the case of the man whose injury
makes necessary the fitting of delicately adjusted
prosthesis and a course of expert training before
he can become a wage earner.</p>

<p>Our chief difficulty in our work of reëducation
will be to secure the right kind of teaching force,
and it is clear that our government must establish
schools to train our technical instructors how to
adapt their knowledge of trade teaching to the kind
of work demanded in giving instruction to the
physically disabled. The selection of the proper
type of teacher is vital to the success of any scheme
of reëducation. The ideal instructor must not only
know his trade but be able to suit his methods to
the individual case so as to get the best response
from each man under his direction. At present it
seems as if there would be no way of training instructors
except by sending chosen trade teachers
to St. Maurice to study the French methods, that
they may return to this country properly equipped
to select and instruct others, until such time as
a government school of the right type is well
established in this country.</p>

<p>As for the schools themselves, they must be
undertaken by the government, even if additional
hospitals and laboratories for research are maintained
by private benevolence and bequest, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
there should be no limit to the funds available for
carrying on this work of the economic rehabilitation
of the men injured in the service of the country,
and it must keep pace with the progressive
work in France and elsewhere. Branch schools in
municipalities may be organized under government
control and subsidized by federal money. Some of
our trade and vocational schools and their equipment
may be taken over by the government for this
purpose. Our trade and technical schools must
also include courses in training teachers for this
special work, the course to be supplemented by a
special preparation prescribed by the government.</p>

<p>In Canada the Military Hospitals Commission
has made a careful study of the French and Anglo-Belgian
treatment in the restoration of disabled
soldiers, and has equipped the Central Military Convalescent
Hospital at Toronto with the mechano-apparatus
similar to that used in France by
Dr. Amar and Dr. Bourillon. Profiting by their
observation of the foreign hospital schools, they
have determined to consider the men in training
as still in hospital and under military rule, for in
Europe there is absolute unanimity of opinion that
the influence of convalescent homes and benevolent
support is bad, conducive to lax discipline and idleness.
Canada has agreed that the earning power
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
subsequently acquired by a pensioner in training
will not lessen his pension. To pass upon the
cases eligible for reëducation, Canada has a board of
three: a member of the Provincial Advisory Committee,
a vocational officer, and a medical man, thus
combining with technical and medical aid advice in
the industrial choice and placement of the man pupil.</p>

<p>Realizing that reëducation is a new idea to most
soldiers and, indeed, to the public generally, Canada
has put forth a propaganda of making popular the
training courses. A bulletin has been posted conspicuously
in public buildings and a printed card
circulated bearing the same information, "What
Every Disabled Soldier Should Know." Aside from
encouragement and directions of where to obtain
help, etc., we find the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That his strength and earning capacity will be restored
in the highest degree possible.</p>

<p>That if his disability prevents him from returning to his
old work, he will receive free training for a new occupation.</p>

<p>That full consideration is given to his own capacity and
desires when a new occupation has to be chosen.</p>

<p>That neither his treatment nor his training nor his
transportation will cost him a cent.</p>

<p>That his maintenance and his family's will be paid for
during his training and for a month after.</p>

<p>That his home province has a special commission to
assist him in finding employment on discharge.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p>To further the publicity of the work in Canada,
moving-picture films have been prepared, systematically
illustrating the treatment and reëducation
of wounded soldiers in England, France, and Canada,
and showing their progress up to the stage
of final recovery. These films have been shown in
hundreds of theaters throughout the Dominion.</p>

<p>It is encouraging that occasionally in France and
Canada the vocational training in connection with
hospitals places a man in a better position financially
than before. The following examples are given out
by the Canadian Military Hospitals Commission and
are testimonials of the possibilities of rehabilitation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Letter received is from an ex-private in the 13th Battalion.
Before enlistment he was getting $12 a week as
driver on a city milk round. "I always had a liking for
drawing," he says, "and I felt that if I ever had the chance
I would take up a course in mechanical drawing." This
opportunity came to him at one of the commission's convalescent
hospitals. After six weeks' application to the
work there, he was able to secure an appointment beginning
with $75 a month, with good prospects of advance.</p>

<p>A locomotive fireman had enlisted, was severely wounded,
and had to have his left arm amputated. Under the commission's
scheme of reëducation, which is offered to all men
incapacitated for their former work by service, he received
special training in telegraphy and railway routine. As a
result he secured an appointment as station agent and
dispatcher at $110 a month.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>In England the high sheriff of Lancashire has
formulated a scheme for listing the employments
open to the disabled. First, the employer is asked,
whenever possible, to give the returned soldier his
old job. Next, certain employments are listed as
being within the powers of partially disabled men,
and with the help of labor exchanges and of other
agencies, these are reserved for them.</p>

<p>It is for the economic interest of the State to
make possible the employment of the disabled.
The amount of a pension is not the measure of the
cost of the pensioner. The nation cannot afford to
let any human power go to waste or lie idle. To
reëquip the maimed is to make him partly forget
his infirmity,&mdash;an indispensable mental advantage.
France is now discussing whether reëducation of
one form or another shall be compulsory, as in the
Anglo-Belgian hospital. "But obligatory or not,"
says A. L. Bittard,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> "the industrial reëducation
must be above all a national work. We should
regard it as a debt owed to the wounded and as
an effective preparation for the future of the
nation.... The State alone is capable of giving all
the mutilated the maximum equality of treatment,
where private initiative would be totally incapable
of realizing the minimum."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>The war simply makes the question of reëducating
and rehabilitating the disabled a striking
one. But we must not forget that the problem of
the injured is always with us. It may not be amiss
to point out that 54,001 men and women were
actually killed in the United States during the year
1913. This means one killed every ten minutes.
Over 2,000,000 men and women are injured in the
industries in the United States each year. This
means one injured every sixteen seconds. The
economic loss from accidental deaths and injuries
is nearly $500,000,000 annually, and the loss from
preventable accidents and diseases would more than
pay the cost of maintaining all the public schools in
the United States. These are appalling figures.</p>

<p>At present the great fear of every boy who goes
to war and of every sister and mother of such a boy
is that he may go through life maimed and dependent.
But we never think of the ever-present
danger to these boys of being handicapped physically
by merely going to work; and yet there are
more persons so disabled through accidents in industrial
life in normal times than are disabled by war.</p>

<p>When our boys come back from the war, physically
disabled, and through the government work
in rehabilitation and reëducation are made self-supporting
and self-respecting members of society,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
we shall begin to appreciate that we have been extremely
negligent in the past in limiting our efforts
to help the crippled and blinded to the good offices
of charity and philanthropy. It is a public matter.
It is a problem of education. It is an opportunity
for service for the teachers of vocational training,
for the experts in vocational guidance and direction,
for the directors of placement and employment
bureaus, and for the designers of special tools and
machines for the handicapped. It is an immediate
problem in this time of war; it is even more
significant in time of peace.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>FARM CADETS</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>We can afford only one fad in war time, and that fad is
to be farming. It will be useless for little William Corning
Smith, aged 12, of Kankakee, Illinois, to stick his little spade
into his back yard before his admiring parent. Individual,
unorganized work on land not properly prepared for agriculture
may be worse than useless; it may be wasteful.
Random efforts not coördinated in a general scheme for the
utilization of school children in large units will be foolish,
misdirected effort. State, county, and even national organization
are required to make available this latent power.
Purely isolated effort will be fruitless, both as aids to the
nation and education for the child. Organized work will
bring the greater moral advantages of developing the power
of concentration along with the interest in national and community
service. It will evoke an esprit de corps which may
be capitalized for national use and shift the usual interest in
gangs and athletics, both normal and natural, to work which
opens the way to loyal industrial educational training.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This was written by John Dewey early in the
spring of 1917 in a message addressed to the principals
and teachers of America on how school
children may be so organized for farm service as to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Aid the nation;</p>

<p>Increase the food supply of the country in war time and
during a world-wide shortage of food;</p>

<p>Conscript the national enthusiasm for athletics to national
usefulness;</p>

<p>Assure a vigorous and healthy rising generation;</p>

<p>Reap the advantage of organized effort with its moral and
educational results;</p>

<p>Develop constructive patriotism.</p></blockquote>

<p>As may be gathered, Dewey's idea was not only
to organize the rural and village children for farm
work but also to send the city children into the
country in camps and tent colonies. He said
further that the plan was not a dream and that
it could be done.</p>

<p>A friend in writing to me of his attempts in
Massachusetts to make the dream a reality said,
"It is like nailing a jellyfish to a board." Referring
to the difficulty of obtaining competent boys,
on the one hand, and of convincing farmers of the
value of city-boy labor, on the other, he further
stated that it was a difficult proposition to sell
something we did not have to somebody who did
not want it.</p>

<p>Few, if any, of us knew very much of the experience,
in this direction, of England, France, and
Germany. To be sure, we had heard that France
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
had attempted in a large way to use children at
farm labor, but had given it up and had replaced
them with old men, women, and partially crippled
returned soldiers; and we knew that with the alarm
of the scarcity of labor and the diminishing number
of the world's acres under cultivation England and
Germany had called upon women and boys below
military age to help meet the needs of the situation.
But we in America did not realize, to quote Dewey
again, "that we could enlist the school children in this
work in such a manner that they could serve with
results as beneficial to themselves as to the nation."</p>

<p>Before considering in some detail the idea of
using agricultural labor of children in America (and
it is a subject worthy of elaboration, for even if
the war closes to-morrow, we shall be short of farm
labor for many years&mdash;perhaps always), let us see
what England and Germany have done to utilize
school children for farm work.</p>

<p>In England many of the boys of 14 to 16 in
the public schools have volunteered for vacation
and holiday agricultural work in hoeing, planting,
and harvesting; some of this was gratuitous labor,
these boys coming from the prosperous classes
and therefore being able to give their services.</p>

<p>In July, 1916, the Education Board published
a report showing the number of children excused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
from attendance at school for the purpose of agricultural
employment in England and Wales on
May 31, 1916. The total number so excused was
15,753, of which number 546 were between the
ages of 11 and 12; 8018 between 12 and 13; 5521
between 13 and 14, and of the remaining 1668
cases the ages were between 12 and 14. Figures
quoted relate solely to agricultural employment
and do not show the full extent of withdrawals
from school. They also relate to withdrawals of
children who are not qualified for total exemption
under the law. The report also states that "the
board has no information as to the number of
children who have been excused from school attendance
for purposes of industrial employment or
employment other than agriculture."</p>

<p>Early in 1917 several of the county education
committees formulated plans for using the labor of
children who were to be excused only for holidays,
special periods, and part times, the general sentiment
being, even in the emergency, that no more
children must be permanently excused for agricultural
or industrial employment. These schemes
are worthy of attention as endeavors to retain
children in school, at the same time modifying
the arrangement of the educational requirements
to allow them to perform farm and garden work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Education Committee for the Lindsay division of
Lincolnshire considered, at a meeting held on April 13, 1917,
the desirability of taking steps to secure that the school
holidays this year are fixed at such times as will enable the
children to be of most assistance to the farmers, and it was
resolved that the finance committee should be requested to
consider the preparation of a scheme enabling managers to
amend the school time-tables in such a way as will give the
maximum of opportunity for the older children to work on
the land during the spring and summer.... They further
considered...that in view of the present emergency and the
need of additional labor, especially in agricultural work, the
board will give favorable considerations to proposals for
extended or additional holidays in rural areas under certain
conditions. Two schemes were presented, setting forth alternative
methods which managers might be authorized to
adopt by which advantage can be taken of the concessions of
the board, as follows: (1) A scheme to give a number up to
eighty additional afternoons on which the older children can
be employed on the land, managers to be informed that a
school year of not less than 320 attendances will be accepted
as fulfilling the requirements of the board, instead of a
minimum of 400 as heretofore. On up to eighty days, older
children, above prescribed age, may be released at noon for
employment on the land, whilst the school will be open as
usual for the younger children, and their attendance recorded,
though not in the official register. (2) A scheme to allow
up to eight weeks extra during which the older children
may be employed on the land, managers to be informed of
the number of attendances required as in scheme one. Older
children, above a prescribed age, who are to be employed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
on the land, need not attend school for a period up to eight
weeks in addition to the ordinary holidays. The school will
be kept open as usual during such weeks for the younger
children, and those attending will have their attendance
recorded, but not in the official register. Under either
scheme it will be necessary for the managers to fix the
period or periods for the year during which the scheme
would be in operation, and in some of the larger rural
schools it might be possible to release a teacher as well as
the older children.</p>

<p>At a meeting held on April 27 it was resolved to issue the
schemes to the managers, impressing upon them the fact that
the one object is to secure increased production of food.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At Grimsby a committee was appointed to consider
the employment of children on gardens, allowing
an acre plot to each school, and 25 children,
under a teacher, to work in cultivating it. All
these children are required to attend school in the
morning, and the consent of their parents must be
obtained by them before they are permitted to
begin afternoon work. Since, as in Lincolnshire,
the aim of the work is increased food production,
the crops derived from the cultivation of the land
acquired by the town are to be divided among
teachers and scholars engaged in the work.</p>

<p>In Hull, also, the Educational Committee, besides
encouraging work in school gardens, has authorized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
the labor of schoolboys in cultivating spare land in
various places as a substitute for their usual manual
training in the school shops.</p>

<p>In Hertfordshire there are school gardens for the
production of potatoes, parsnips, beets, and onions,
with school instruction in gardening given the
pupils. During the period for planting there is a
schedule of half-time attendance. In Bradford the
successful vegetable gardening is correlated with
the school work in nature study, composition, arithmetic,
and drawing, and emphasis is placed on the
educational value of the productive work.</p>

<p>It is difficult for America to see the food crisis as
do the nations which are near the exhaustion point.
While everyone must deplore the wholesale excusing
of children to work without supervision, we
ought to watch with interest all schemes which
will increase production and yet will keep younger
children in school for full time and will permit those
older to work part time. This part-time work should
be confined to the years of 14 to 18, except possibly
in the case of work in the school garden, where
younger children may labor for short periods.</p>

<p>The appeal of Neville Chamberlain, the Director-general
of National Service, in the spring of 1917,
for volunteers from such boys as were able to
make the sacrifice, connects the need for agricultural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
labor with the necessity for providing proper supervision
of the boys. His plan for utilizing the labor
of English schoolboys has many features similar to
devices employed in Massachusetts, New York, and
New Jersey.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is well understood that an abundant supply of labor
for the land during the coming summer months is an urgent
national necessity. Many schemes have already been organized
for the employment of soldiers, women, and prisoners
of war, but it is desirable to form a reserve of labor so
organized as to be available at short notice. For this
reserve I turn to the boys at our public and other secondary
schools. During the last two years many of them have
given valuable help in hoeing, harvesting, and timber cutting,
and at the present crisis I confidently hope that all
for whom it is possible will make their services available
both in summer holidays and, if necessary, during the
coming term. I have accepted the offer of the Cavendish
Association to place at my disposal their organization,
which will act in conjunction with a committee&mdash;representative
of schools and masters&mdash;having its headquarters
at St. Ermin's, and working under the director of the agricultural
section of this department. Full particulars of the
arrangements and procedure will shortly be issued by the
committee. The main points are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) The age of the boys permitted to volunteer should
not be below 16 except in the cases where the school
authorities consider boys of 15 sufficiently strong to undertake
the necessary work. (2) The boys will be organized in
squads of varying sizes, each in charge of a master or other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
responsible person. (3) It is proposed that during term
time the period of continuous whole-time service should not
exceed two weeks. Every effort will be made to find work
for schoolboy volunteers in the neighborhood of the school,
but if the work lies at some distance from the school, railway
fares will be paid and careful provision will be made
for board and lodging. No boy will be expected to volunteer
for service during term whose school work is of immediate
importance; for example, a boy who is preparing for
a scholarship examination. I recognize that this part of the
scheme may present some difficulties to all but the large
public schools, but I hope that some of the larger state-aided
secondary schools may be able to join in it. Before
doing so, however, they should communicate with the Board
of Education. (4) In the holidays they will work for not
less than three or four weeks, and it is hoped that, if necessary,
they may have leave of absence from school until the
end of September. (5) The whole working hours will be
carefully proportioned to the average strength of each squad,
and the wages adjusted accordingly. If the total sum
earned does not meet the cost of living, the deficit will
under special conditions be made up.</p>

<p>I trust that when the call for boys' help comes, parents
will recognize its urgency and will not hesitate to allow
their sons to render this service for their country.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Germany there has been a systematic contribution
from schools to agriculture since March,
1915. Authority was given to the respective school
officials to grant the necessary leave of absence
to older children for farm and garden cultivation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
With the increasing need of securing a sufficient
supply of food for the nation, excuses of pupils from
school increased. An additional service of pupils
was required by an order issued on May 15, 1917,
relative to combating fruit and vegetable pests.</p>

<p>Looking forward to future scarcity, Germany, with
the help of the teaching staff and government
leaflets, next enlisted school children in the work
of collecting field and forest edible products. Children
were engaged in the work of gleaning, and
in the summer of 1915 the gleanings amounted to
approximately $50,000, the greater part of which
was turned over to the Red Cross as the children's
contribution. In the summer and autumn of 1915
the children aided, too, in gathering fruits. During
the following winter the schools gave instruction
in the substitution of fruit products for fat and proteid.
These were pointed lessons both in frugality
and in public spirit.</p>

<p>Additional requirement of the children's services
was made when the continued scarcity of fats made
it imperative to conserve acorns, horse-chestnuts,
and seeds containing oil, the gathering of which
was impossible without the aid of school children.
An order of August 21, 1916, authorized the employment
of children to take part in the extraction
from trees in the state forests of resin needed chiefly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
for the paper industry; and in the same season
children were called upon to engage in the collection
of kernels of cherries, plums, and apricots in
enormous quantities for oil extraction.</p>

<p>The school administrators and teachers of America
knew little, if anything, of the farm-placement
ventures of European countries. But they were
told most emphatically in the spring of 1917 that
the military force was but one factor in national
organization, and that the ultimate decision as to
victory might well be with the farmer. So in
American fashion we started at it; New Jersey
with its "junior industrial army," Massachusetts
with its bronze-badged boy farmers, and New
York with its "farm cadets."</p>

<p>We all thought we were original, and perhaps
we were; and yet it is certainly not new for schoolboys
to work outside the school session when of
proper age. Whether for the father or a neighborhood
employer, boys 14 and over have worked
in stores and gardens, in summer hotels, in offices,
garages, and manufacturing plants. Nor is it unusual,
for that matter, to have the outside work
coördinated with the school and receiving due credit
in the curriculum. The coöperative high-school
and vocational courses in many cities&mdash;Fitchburg,
Beverly, Providence, Hartford, Indianapolis, Chicago,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
and New York&mdash;are well known to those who are
familiar with the extension and coöperative efforts
of our vocational schools.</p>

<p>Furthermore we are familiar with the two types
of camps: the adult-labor and the recreation camp.
The work camp is much the older, dating back
to the building of railroads and the opening of
lumber districts. In the past decade the recreation
summer camps have become a potent factor in
secondary-school life, making a complement of
the school year's work by laying stress on the
physical development of outdoor woodland and
country experiences. Some of these camps, while
primarily recreational, have had courses in manual
training, college preparation, arts and crafts, and
languages, yet so clearly is their play nature of
chief importance that no one thinks of them as
work camps.</p>

<p>Now the farm-cadet movement involves the farm
labor of the schoolboy, who is sent out and credited
for his work by his school and is added to a camp
life where in a squad of his fellow schoolboys he
is looked after by an appointed leader as if in
a Y.M.C.A. camp. Thus we have, out of familiar
ingredients, a new compound, bringing into relation
the boy, the parent, the supervisor, the employer,
and the school.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>This agricultural movement in connection with
the schools had its inception at the Philadelphia
meeting of the Eastern Arts and Manual Training
Teachers' Association early in 1917. At once three
Eastern states&mdash;Massachusetts, New Jersey, and
New York&mdash;began to formulate plans for its operation.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
For it was not to be the simple expedient
of excusing boys from school to work on farms, as
has been the practice in many localities, but a plan
whereby the boy was to be retained in the school
system, substituting in his course during a portion
of the year agricultural work for the academic and
vocational studies of the regular curriculum.</p>

<p>In analyzing the problem it was found that
there were three types of boys to be considered:
(1) the boy in a farming district, who could be
employed on the farm of his father or a neighbor;
(2) the boy in a town near an agricultural center,
who could be employed within a radius of a few
miles of his home and school; (3) the boy from
a city, who would have to be sent to distant farms
and whose welfare would not be in the charge of
his school principal and parents. The case of the
first boy is very simple; the second is also easy
of solution; but if the third boy is to be used,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
there will need to be a carefully worked-out plan
for his placement, record of work, accommodations,
and general welfare. It is for the third boy that
the camp must be established, where he will be
looked after by a responsible person who will see
that he has the proper tent, board, work, and
sanitary arrangements.</p>

<p>The plans of the different states for utilizing
boy power, while aiming toward the one desirable
end of increasing our food production, have differed
widely in detail, owing to the variation in
the compulsory-attendance laws, to the latitude
exercised in some states in excusing boys prematurely,
and to the varying degrees of investigation
of placement, record of work, and supervision.
All states agree in giving the boy who is excused
for farm work credit in his school work. Canada,
too, excuses boys over 14 for farm work, allowing
them full school credit for three months' labor.
While it may be urged that it is not pedagogically
sound to give credit in one subject for the work
in another, a way out of the difficulty might be
found in a rearrangement of the school year and
vacations in districts where there is a large percentage
of excused boys; or special classes could
be devised for these boys when they return to
school. In the large high schools shorter intensive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
courses could be included in the program so that
the boy who was preparing for college would not
lose his work in such subjects as English, history,
and mathematics. In the case of language and
science there must be a loss which it is difficult
to repair. If the present conditions persist, administrative
ingenuity can solve the question of work
and credits. It is not one of the serious aspects of
the problem, provided always that there is no release
of children below the compulsory-attendance age.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts the work of mobilizing schoolboys
for farm labor was in charge of the state's
Committee on Public Safety. Their principles in
acting were as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mobilize the schoolboys; keep those under 16 at home to
work on home, school, and community gardens; enlist the
high-school boys between 16 and 18, too young for military
or naval service, but old enough to render real service; move
them where farm labor is needed; make them understand
that enlistment for farm service is in all ways as patriotic
as any other service for the nation's defense.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the appointment of a subcommittee to formulate
the detailed scheme of placement and supervision,
having Frank V. Thompson, Assistant
Superintendent of the Boston schools, as chairman,
the plan for the coöperation of schools with
agriculture is, for boys 16 and over, as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

<p>1. (<i>a</i>) The farm-labor service is to be recognized
by a bronze badge containing the seal of the commonwealth
and inscribed "The Nation's Service" and
"Food Production." (<i>b</i>) An honorable discharge,
similar to a discharge from the army, containing the
signature of the governor, will be issued to boys
who successfully complete their service on farms.
(<i>c</i>) Tufts, Boston University, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, and Massachusetts Agricultural
College have agreed to give a trial term or year to
such candidates as present an honorable discharge,
without further entrance requirements, provided
their school work was satisfactory up to the time
of leaving and the principal so recommends.</p>

<p>2. The existing school organization is used to
conduct the enterprise. For each 25 boys enlisted
a supervisor is appointed, a male teacher of strong
ability in the local school,&mdash;in towns where there
are several supervisors, either the superintendent
of schools or the principal of the high school.
A general head supervisor in charge of the state
work has an office in the Statehouse. Each local
head supervisor and each supervisor of 25 boys
receives the same sum ($100), the money being
obtained from a local contingent fund, from an
additional appropriation, or by subscription.</p>

<p>3. The minimum wage of the boys is fixed thus:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
first week, no wages, but allowance of $2 for expenses
etc.; thereafter (<i>a</i>) boy living on farm, not less
than $4 a week and board, (<i>b</i>) boy living at home,
not less than $6 a week. Six days constitute a week.</p>

<p>4. The enlistment card and the issuance of
honorable discharge are controlled by the general
head supervisor (Committee on Public Safety).</p>

<p>5. The enrollment for the period of May 1 to
October 1 is made by the boy, with the parents'
consent and the school physician's endorsement.
When the boy is enlisted, a numbered badge is
lent to him, for which he signs a receipt; it is
to be returned in case of unsatisfactory conduct
or service. He receives full credit for the year's
school work.</p>

<p>6. Inspection of the physical and moral conditions
of the place of employment, the choosing of
the boys from enrollment lists, and seeing that
both boys and farmers are satisfied, are part of the
work of the appointed supervisors.</p>

<p>7. Camps for the boys, when local conditions
require, are established under the direction of the
medical expert for the State Board of Labor and
Industries. An expert on camps has supervision
of the work of the executive committee in standardizing
and inspecting camps and obtaining the
equipment, layout, and food supplies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

<p>With the coöperation of farm bureaus thousands
of circulars and labor-contract forms were sent to
Massachusetts farmers. By June 16, 1917, there
were camps established at 18 points, and arrangements
completed to employ 500 to 600 boys from
these camps. In addition there were at least 500
other boys released from school to work on home
farms, or living in farmers' homes.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the Massachusetts
scheme was the working out of camp plans by the
drafting students in the Newton Technical High
School, with detailed equipment of dining tent with
wooden-horse tables; sleeping tent with double-deck
bunk; latrine; cook shack; etc.</p>

<p>In its system for handling the supply of boy
labor, the state requires the farmer to sign a definite
application blank for the amount of boy labor
which he requires. It is understood that while
the boys are enlisted for the entire period up to
October 1, the farmer may take those boys for
long or short periods of not less than a week in
duration, to begin or end at any time, as the
farmer's necessity requires. This application made
by the farmer is also an agreement to pay the
wages stipulated by the Committee on Public Safety
and also to employ the boy on rainy as well as
fair days, using his services on rainy days under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
cover if possible. Further agreement is made, in
case the boy is unsatisfactory, to give him one
week's notice or one week's pay, providing him
with a statement in writing of the reason for his
discharge. Whenever, in the opinion of the local
supervisor, the conditions of living or of labor are
not satisfactory, the boy may be withdrawn without
prejudice to him. These arrangements insure that
there shall be a coöperative responsibility of farmer
and state in caring for the boy.</p>

<p>In establishing the camps in Massachusetts the
money to start the work was chiefly supplied by
individuals. In the case of the New Bedford contingent
in Coonamesett camp, on an estate of
11,000 acres, the boys were housed in militia tents,
lent by the state,&mdash;two boys to a tent. For their
tent furnishings the boys supplied whatever they
needed. A mess house&mdash;a rough board building
75 feet long by 17 feet wide, providing eating
quarters for the boys and at one end a cook room&mdash;was
in part erected by the New Bedford Industrial
School boys, working under the direction of an
experienced carpenter. The laying of the 2500 feet
of pipe to carry water to the camp was also the
work of the same school. The catering for the
boys was under the direction of an experienced
woman and two Japanese cooks. In the morning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
the boys started for the various farms, those at a
distance being called for by an auto truck. In this
camp, for an eight-hour day and a six-day week
each boy received a maximum wage of $4 a week
and board, the weekly payment in charge of the
supervisor. The camp was fortunate in having as
its directors the city superintendent of schools and
a physical instructor, the latter living in the camp.</p>

<p>In New York the placing of boys on farms has
been the joint work of the Food Supply Commission,
the State Education Department, and the
State Military Training Commission. While younger
boys have been released for agricultural work by
other agencies, the state placement by the commission
is concerned only with the boys of military
training age&mdash;16 to 19. One of the first actions
of the latter commission was to divide the state
into 6 military-training zones: New York City (including
Manhattan, Bronx, and Richmond); Long
Island, including Brooklyn; Hudson Valley, with
center at Albany; East Central, at Syracuse; West
Central, at Rochester; and Western, at Buffalo.
Next, a description was obtained of the character
of the work in each zone. For example, the Hudson
Valley Zone as far as Albany requires labor in
harvesting small fruits and general farm work,
while the West Central Zone work is that of muck
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
farming, large-fruit farming, and general farming.
Each zone center has its individual office through
which placements are made. Meetings were held
the latter part of April by zone supervisors and
farm-bureau managers, and attended by farmers'
and fruit growers' associations who stated what
they needed and what they would contribute in
wages and housing for boy workers.</p>

<p>The inducements for enlisting offered by the state
to boys released from school work were the chevron
given by the Military Training Commission, to be
awarded after thirty days' satisfactory work; the
military-training-equivalent value of the service; and
the promise of proper pay and care by the employer.
As to credits, so important in the New York
system, farm cadets were permitted to take the
Regents' examinations though the course lacked a
few weeks of completion, the time requirement being
waived in their case. Any pupil in the schools
of the state who enlisted for military service
(this applied to the colleges) or who rendered
satisfactory agricultural service was credited with
the work of the term without examination, on the
certificate of the school that his work up to the
time of enlistment was satisfactory.</p>

<p>New York is an agricultural state, with a great
variety of kinds of farming and many districts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
remote from centers of the supply of labor. The
agricultural census, to which reference was made
in Chapter II, supplied data for determining the
districts where and when labor was most needed
and where schoolboys could be most useful. For
example, in Orleans County, in the Western Zone,
the demand varied from 163 laborers needed early
in May to 1521 needed in October, an indication
that there was really more reason for excusing boys
in October than in May for work in peach- and
apple-harvesting districts.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Conspicuous among the
types of New York farms where labor was sought
were the great fruit farms, such as the Sodus Fruit
Farm, with a house on the shore of Lake Ontario
able to accommodate 100 boys, where it was planned
to harvest the entire peach and apple crop with
schoolboy labor; the vast tracts owned by the
canning companies, with thousands of acres of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
tomatoes, beans, and corn under cultivation; and
the farms such as those in the South Lima district,
where there was muck farming and where the
work included the cultivating, sorting, and packing
of onions, lettuce, celery, and spinach. Calls
were sometimes made upon the state for as many
as 1500 boys to assist in harvesting. It was therefore
necessary for the state to work on a large
and definitely planned scale.</p>

<p>Naturally the first boys to be placed were those
residing in or near farming districts. When, however,
the supply of these boys was exhausted, the
call came, even from remote districts, for city boys.
In these cases the problem of transportation becomes
serious, as well as the housing and care of
the boy in the new environment, where association
with other help is apt to be harmful.</p>

<p>The following description of a New York State
camp is offered not only because it has proved to
be highly successful but also because it affords
an excellent illustration of the "farm-working, or
labor-distributing, camp," which is defined in the
chapter following.</p>

<p>It was called The Erasmus Hall High School
(New York City) Potato Growers' Association, and
was organized by F. A. Rexford, a teacher who is
much interested in agriculture and in boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>The object of the association, which was formed
in the school, was originally fourfold: (1) to teach
the farmer that the alert city boy can and will
perform agricultural tasks; (2) to increase the food
supply; (3) to relieve the help situation by organizing
a group of boys to work by the hour or
day, and to recruit boys to work by the month
for individual farmers under supervision; (4) to fit
boys for military service if needed.</p>

<p>Ten boys from the school left New York on
May 5, each armed with the money necessary to
pay such expenses as carfare, food, laundry, rent of
an acre of land, seed potatoes, phosphate, team hire,
and spraying materials. They went to Mr. Rexford's
farm, located up-state. The <i>New York Tribune</i> contributed
some money, and one of the teachers in
the school advanced $60 for the boys to grow
potatoes for him. Some frail boys, whose parents
wanted them to go for their health, were refused.</p>

<p>At first the farmers were skeptical. The boys,
however, went to work on the land which they
had rented from Rexford. In a week they began
to attract attention and farmers began to hire
them. Rexford knew some of these farmers by
reputation. He believed that men who cannot
keep their own boys at home cannot succeed with
boys from the city. He was in the habit of having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
a straight talk with the employing farmers, telling
them that the boys must be treated squarely.</p>

<p>A large milk-distributing corporation offered to
take every one of his boys, but he argued that it
could afford to hire men and did not need boys,
as did the farmers who could not obtain other help.
It is evident that large farmers have capital and
backing, while it is the individual farmer struggling
with hard conditions who must have help.</p>

<p>Most of the boys who are with farmers by the
month come back to the main camp every Sunday
morning for physical examination, general assembly,
and to go to church. This coming back to the
camp keeps before them the idea of a camp for
farm cadets. They return to their work Sunday
night. For those boys who go out by the week
the teacher makes an arrangement whereby the
farmer brings them back to the camp on Saturday
night and comes for them the following night.</p>

<p>The people in the community in which the camp
is located have established a nonsectarian church
in an old cheese factory which has been purchased
for $200. Occasionally a minister from a near-by
town comes and speaks.</p>

<p>The camp has a professional cook, who was
obtained from a college fraternity, and the boys
pay pro rata. The first expense was about $2.50
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
a week for each boy, but prosperity has provided
means for the boys to spend more.</p>

<p>All vegetables which the boys raised and which
they did not use on the table were canned by
the cook and Mrs. Rexford, and they will be used
in the early part of next year, before the fresh
vegetables are available.</p>

<p>Local store men have coöperated in giving the
lowest prices, feeling that otherwise the trade of the
camp would go to the city, and therefore choosing
the opportunity of large business with aggregate
large receipts on small profit.</p>

<p>Breakfast consists of fruit, cereal or eggs, and
milk, cocoa, or postum, and sometimes corn bread
or griddle cakes. The boys carry a cold lunch
with them, consisting of a pail of cold cocoa;
four good thick sandwiches of peanut butter, meat,
or jam; a piece of frosted cake; and a banana.
Sometimes they take a pot of jam, which is disposed
of by the group. For dinner they have a roast
or steak; potatoes and other ordinary vegetables
(beans, peas, lettuce, carrots); shortcake or pie or
pudding; cocoa, postum, or milk.</p>

<p>The boys take care of their own beds, wash
the dishes, and keep the place clean.</p>

<p>They have a study hour every evening from
eight until nine, and the same is true of the boys
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
placed out with farmers. One boy, going to
Princeton in the fall, kept up his studies and took
the Regents' examinations at the country school,
passing them with as good a mark as he would
have obtained at his home school.</p>

<p>After drill on Sunday morning the boys at
camp have a baseball game. They have had
entertainments for the benefit of the Red Cross.
In the group at camp are the gold-medal orator
of the school, two excellent pianists, four mandolin
players, and a whistler. All the boys are
good singers.</p>

<p>Rexford's application blank asked for the weight,
age, previous experience in farming, church preference,
and habits as to smoking.</p>

<p>The teacher had the coöperation of the farm
bureau. The farmers wrote to the bureau for help;
Mr. Rexford and the farm-bureau manager went
to each farmer, looked over the situation, and if
everything was satisfactory, furnished the workers.
Mr. Rexford will not leave boys on any farm
without proper supervision. He visits the boys
once every week, neither the farmer nor the boy
knowing when he is coming.</p>

<p>At first no wage scale was set, the arrangement
being that the farmer should pay what the
boy was worth. If he was worth nothing, then it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
was all right, and the boy ought to be the first one
to know it. However, most of the boys started
at 20 cents an hour; soon this was raised to 25
cents, and now the pay is 30 cents.</p>

<p>Most of the farmers in the vicinity had never
done any spraying. They now apply to Mr. Rexford
when they want such work done and he sends out
two boys and horses and his own spraying outfit.
The work is done at a cost to the farmer of
about 70 cents per acre for spraying potatoes, in
addition to the material; that is, 25 cents per acre
for each boy's work and 20 cents expense on the
spraying outfit, for nozzles etc.</p>

<p>There was no illness among the boys during the
summer, not even colds. Sometimes the boys got
wet through, but came home, took a dip in a hole
in the creek, and followed it by a good rub.</p>

<p>Meanwhile quite a number of New York City
men teachers under the leadership of two camp
supervisors, H. W. Millspaugh and H. J. McCreary,
and acting under the authority of the Board of
Education, started out "to sell something they did
not have to somebody who did not want it." But
these men had the courage of their convictions
and the results of their work (over twenty camps
in two counties) give ample evidence of the success
of their venture.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>Imagine the surprise of the fruit growers of the
counties named when they received the following
circular letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is proposed to bring a large number of boys from the
high schools of New York City to pick fruit in the fruit
belt of Orange and Ulster counties. In carrying out this
plan it will be necessary to have the full coöperation of
fruit growers, school authorities, parents, health authorities,
and others. The part of the fruit grower will be roughly
as follows:</p>

<p>He will provide housing facilities, stove, fuel, refrigeration,
either by ice box, cellar, or spring, convenient water
supply, toilet facilities satisfactory to the board of health,
straw for mattresses, cooking utensils, working conditions that
will enable the average boy to earn a respectable wage, and
a sympathetic attitude toward the comfort and health of the
boys.</p>

<p>Each boy will provide his carfare to and from the fruit
section, provide his own knife, fork, cup, plate, spoon, wash
basin, tick for mattress, pillow, blankets, etc., and pay for
his food and cooking. Boys will mess in groups of 12 to
25 or even more. Each group will have a capable boy cook
and in camps of over 20, two boys. The first boy will receive
$4 a week besides his meals, the second boy $2.50 a
week and may earn some more by picking fruit. A teacher
supervisor will supervise one large or two or three small
camps and advise as to preparation of food, buy supplies,
and act as camp director.</p>

<p>Regarding cooking outfit to be supplied by the fruit
grower, it may be said that all except stove and ice box can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
be purchased new for about $10. It is desirable that these
be ordered by the camp director, who will judge the size and
kind and take advantage of wholesale rates. An oil stove
and oven is recommended unless a suitable stove is on hand.
Inexperienced boy cooks cannot be expected to satisfy a
score or more of hungry boys with equipment discarded by
the skilled housewife.</p>

<p>It is further understood that these boys will not work on
Sunday nor will they be located on farms where farm help
is not treated with consideration.</p></blockquote>

<p>An illustration of a "concentration and training
camp" is that established by the state of Maine.
This state, in coöperation with the state Young
Men's Christian Association, developed a state
camp for the purpose of enlisting and training
boys and young men to supply the extra demand
for farm labor made necessary through the increased-acreage
propaganda. The boys were organized
under the title of "The Junior Volunteers
of Maine." They were virtually farm soldiers of
the state, and were sworn to obey all rules of the
camp before and after leaving it for the farms on
which they were placed.</p>

<p>The boys are sent out in squads to work in
different sections of the state, as opportunity may
offer, under the direction of competent adult leaders.
These leaders have full charge of the boys until
they return to the mobilization camp.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

<p>When a boy comes to the camp he is examined
for his moral and physical qualifications, and then
is assigned to a company and to a tent. The
adjutant general provides necessary tents, uniforms,
and camp utensils. The boy is instructed with
others in the squad how to pitch a tent and pack
camp utensils, and he is also given lessons in
sanitation and the elements of military drill. He
has a lecture every day given by a professor of
the state agricultural college. He also works on
the Y.M.C.A. farm, which is being used for this
purpose, and is taught the use of machinery, and
how to manage and care for horses, sharpen tools,
and milk cows.</p>

<p>It is not claimed that a week of this sort of
training makes the boy a finished farmer, but it
does go a long way in that preliminary education
so essential to farm-mindedness. By the time
the boy gets to the farmer he is in excellent
shape to understand the orders of his employer.
In the words of the director of the camp, "He is
ready to begin actual service as a trained novice."</p>

<p>Before the boy is admitted to the camp a
searching examination is made into his character
and antecedents, and some responsible person
must answer certain confidential questions relative
to the boy's physical, mental, and social habits.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p>After the boy is admitted to the camp he takes
an oath in which he states that he will serve as
a junior volunteer for farm service in Maine until
the last day of October, unless sooner released by
the governor of the state of Maine.</p>

<p>A charge is made on the farmer of $1 a day for
each of the six working days, and it is expected
that if the boys show themselves worthy of more,
the farmer will recognize this and make a satisfactory
adjustment with the leader. In addition
to the minimum charge of $1 a day the farmer
is required to furnish board. As a rule, however,
the boys sleep in near-by tents with their leaders.
The farmer is not required to pay transportation
or other charges.</p>

<p>The farmer's agreement is with the state and not
with the boy, as the scheme works on the basis that
the young men have been engaged by the state for
farm service and as employees of the state receive
their pay through the regular state channels.</p>

<p>On the first of July more than 450 boys had been
trained and sent out to various points in the state.</p>

<p>The following letter from the director-general
of the camp gives in a word his experience with
these boys:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We feel that this movement can be justified from any
one of a half-dozen standpoints. We are taking city boys
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
and in a few weeks giving them a few carefully selected
fundamental principles relating to practical farm activities,
which has enabled them to go out to the farms under our
leaders and give satisfaction. We have not had a single
complete failure yet. Only 3 boys out of 600 employed
for the season have been changed because they could not
fill the requirements. The way these city boys have taken
hold of farm work has been wonderfully gratifying. In
connection with this training, we are conducting our camp
along lines similar to camps of National Guardsmen. The
whole organization is nearly identical with the regular army
camps. While the training is not so extensive, the boys
are given the fundamentals in correct form. The spirit
and general training at the camp will be of great value if
any of these boys are ever called into the service.</p>

<p>Another important possibility, and from my experience
with city boys, a probability, is that some of these boys will
become sufficiently interested in agriculture to choose it as
a vocation, while others will choose it later in life as an
avocation, because of this experience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another mobilization camp of the "labor-distribution"
type, with some training features, was that
of the Long Island Food Reserve Battalion. This
organization was initiated by the Nassau County
Y.M.C.A. and supported financially and morally
by the Long Island Railroad, the state agricultural
school at Farmingdale, and by local residents.
A detailed description is unnecessary. There were
6 camps under this organization scattered over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
the island, in each camp 48 boys under a supervisor,
a military instructor, and squad leaders (1 squad
leader to approximately every 7 boys). The last
camp was developed at the state school of agriculture
with a group of 96 boys working in two
shifts, one beginning at 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and stopping at
12 noon; the other beginning at 12 noon and stopping
at 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> A regular course of agricultural
instruction was carried on at all the camps. Lectures
have been given in entomology, farm chemistry,
and marketing. During the first month of the
first camp it was difficult to place the boys. The
idea was not well received by the farmers, who
claimed that the presence of boys would "demoralize"
their regular help, and that the boys would
not recognize the different vegetables and would
hoe out corn as quickly as they would pigweed.
(One boy in a New York State camp did carefully
hoe out and pull up every corn plant for a half-day,
leaving weeds.)</p>

<p>During the height of the season these same
farmers were driving to the camps and offering from
$2 to $2.50 a day for the same boys that they had
laughed at hiring for $1.25 a day at the beginning
of the installation of the camps.</p>

<p>The "flying-squadron" idea is unique. An auto
truck, with a trailer for tentage and supplies, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
always ready to respond with its load of boys to an
emergency call to save some particular crop. The
group composing this squadron is made up of
"hand-picked" boys who are qualifying for squad-leader
positions.</p>

<p>An example of a camp which was conducted in
such a manner that the boys lost the minimum of
school work is that of the Bushwick (Brooklyn,
New York), High School "Camp Squire" near
Hicksville, Long Island. The organization of this
camp is interesting, not so much because it was
established with the purpose of making it self-supporting,
but rather because it provided definite
opportunities for continuing with school studies.
The initial amount of about $175 was subscribed
by teachers, and the tent and mess house, intended
formerly for harvesters, was lent by the farmer on
whose grounds the camp was placed. The leader
of this camp, a teacher in the same school from
which the boys were recruited, planned, after the
schools opened in September, a day of work and
study, coaching the boys in their school subjects,
so that with at least three hours of study per day
the boys were enabled to keep up with their
classes while at work harvesting until the middle
of October. In this, as in other successful camps,
the boys formed a unit organization before going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
to camp, and had the advantage of a sympathetic
instructor of academic and agricultural experience
to enforce voluntary school discipline. The boys
were paid 20 to 25 cents an hour, working for
neighboring farmers from 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The
rest of the day was divided into silent study, consultation,
and recreation hours. It is expected that
this camp, which will doubtless be permanent, will
become self-supporting in its second or third year
and the initial outlay will be returned.</p>

<p>The farm-camp idea is here to stay. Of that we
are sure. The purely recreational camp is a thing
of the past. The days of the purely work camp of
ten to twelve hours a day ought to be over. Work,
play, and study in the future will be brought together
in the summer time as effectively as during
the so-called "regular" season. Next year, and in
the years after, we shall organize this work around
some educational ideal and not merely around a
necessity for food-production. The two are by no
means incompatible.</p>

<p>This year we have learned "how not to do it,"
as one camp leader put it. In some instances the
boys went home with less money than they had
at the start. In brief they paid the farmer for the
privilege of picking berries. Particularly in berry
picking there was much piece work, and such may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
carry with it nearly all the evils that it does in the
factory. Mr. Keller, a thoughtful leader of a New
York camp, says in this connection: "Judging the
fair wage from the earnings of the expert is manifestly
unfair. It means that the average boy must
be speeded up beyond his point of endurance, or
that he must receive less than a living wage. The
possibilities of speeding up are limited, and so
the alternative is longer hours."</p>

<p>Furthermore it is necessary for the government,
state or national, to take a hand in the distribution
and the sale of farm products. It made me
sick at heart, on a trip of inspection to 25 camps,
to see hundreds of boys at work picking berries
under the hot sun in a service supposedly patriotic,
and then to see the same berries, which had been
sold by the growers at a price not much above that
of other years, resold to the consumer at double
the price of other years,&mdash;and always with the
remark: "You know labor is scarce this year, and
the farmers cannot get help." The result of it all
has been that the consumer, for whom the work
was done, has been disregarded.</p>

<p>From the point of view of social reconstruction,
education, food production, and conservation only
the surface has been scratched. The state must take
the initiative, assuring the consumer a moderate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
price for the product, and the farmer, the dealer,
and the boy a fair return for their service.</p>

<p>The boy is not merely a labor unit in the conservation
of food. He is the essential feature of an
educational program. The experience of the past
summer proves that with centralization, organization,
and an educational vision as fundamental sub-divisions
of a far-sighted state policy the placing
of boy labor on farms could become a valuable and
permanent by-product of the war.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE ORGANIZATION OF A CADET CAMP</small></h2>

<p>In organizing camps for supplying cadet labor
it is well to keep in mind that they are to be established
on the basis of a business proposition; that
they are not primarily play camps or recreational
camps; that they are not to be located on a river
or lake because there happens to be a good place
for boys to swim, if there are not paying jobs near
that river or lake on which the boys may work;
that they are not to be established at random without
reference to the continuity of work during
the season, or without any real knowledge of the
local demand for labor.</p>

<p>Out of considerable experience during the past
year it has been discovered that there are three
great elements: first, the boy; second, the farmer;
and third, the job. In addition there are the elements
of leadership, of housing, and of cooking.
Of course there must also be considered the elements
of recreation, religious observances, and the
general social life of the camp.</p>

<p>With reference to the boy it would seem that
he ought to be one of a group which belongs to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
a public-school system, or to an institution, or to
some society or organization which is ready to coöperate
in placing him in a farm camp. We are
hardly prepared as yet to take individual boys,
unassociated with any organization, and bring them
together in a camp where the lack of unity will
give the leader little hold. A number of boys
from New York City were picked up at random
and sent out to a distant place up-state under the
direction of a leader who had never seen them
before. The boys had not met one another until
they were put on a train in New York. Not
coming from any single school or organization,
they felt no particular responsibility to anyone. All
they knew about the proposition was that they
were to go to a certain place, where they would
be met by someone who was to conduct them to a
camp. They were undisciplined and later proved to
be unmanageable. At the very start the plan lacked
that coördinating influence which would have existed
if the leader had been a teacher in a school
from which these boys had come as one group, or
if a Y.M.C.A. boys' secretary had organized a group
from his association. Of course, some day a way
may be found to bring together a group of boys
independent of previous association and place them
in a new environment in about the same way that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
adult labor is gathered up in the streets of New
York and shipped by employment agencies to some
distant point. But boys are not men. The responsibility
of sending a more or less irresponsible
youth to a distant point by the same methods that
are used by employment agencies in sending men
is too great for any state or community to undertake.</p>

<p>It is generally understood that the best boys for
farm work are those who are over 16 years of age.
This is true, of course, of boys who engage in
general farm work, such as plowing, milking, horse
cultivating, haying, and harvesting grains and potatoes.
Many such boys were placed in the dairying
and general-farming regions of New York State.
These boys, in most cases, lived with the individual
farmer and were paid by the month. But it has
been found from experience that the 14-year-old boy
is often better adapted to certain types of farm work
than is the older boy. For example, the young boy,
with his adolescent enthusiasm, his nimbler fingers,
and his general physical alertness, is more desirable
for picking small fruits, such as strawberries, currants,
raspberries, blackberries, gooseberries, and
cherries. <i>The 14-year-old boy must, however, work
on a different basis from the one who is over 16.</i></p>

<p>It is necessary for the boys to pass a physical
examination, because no state authorities care to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
assume the responsibility of taking the physically
unfit. It is taken for granted that the boy is to
fit into the organization of the camp as a business
proposition and that he is to stick to his work,
pay his share of the cost of the food and its
preparation, respond to leadership, and in every
way do his part toward promoting the general
efficiency of the camp.</p>

<p>The enlistment blank used by the New York
State Military Training Commission is shown on
page 276.</p>

<p>The farmer is as important an element as the
boy; yes, even more important, for the boy gradually
loses his individuality in the camp conscience.
The individual farmer remains an individual. He
has his notions of what boys can do; he compares
the work of the inexperienced boy with the adult
foreign labor which he has previously employed.
The latter has, until very recently, been available.
Women with their children came to his farm and
picked the small fruits without much regard to the
length of the day's work or to living conditions, and,
of course, without any reference to the social life
of the community. This labor went out as it came
in. If it did not like the job because the pay
was insufficient, it demanded higher wages and got
them or left the job and moved on to the next one.

<p>It did not mind shacks which lodged vermin. It
was not particular about sanitary conveniences; it
was not particular about anything except wages.
In shifting from adult foreign labor to boy labor,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
the farmer was obliged to readjust his mental attitude.
Not only that, but he often had to readjust
the physical, economic, and social conditions on
his farm.</p>

<p>In April, at the time the New York agricultural
census was taken, the farmer said that he needed
labor. He even said he would take boy labor, but
when it came actually to engaging such labor, he
was inclined to ridicule the idea. Untrained city
boys were not in great demand in May, but when
the foreign labor did not appear on the scene and
strawberries were ripening on the vines, the farmer
suddenly discovered that he could use the untrained
city boy. But he had expected the boys not only
to work as many hours but also to pick as carefully
and as much as adults. He expected the boys
to work at the same price as had foreigners for
years past, regardless of the advance in price of
food and the standards of living. Of course he was
disappointed, and this is where the leader of the
camp, through his authority, represents the interests
of the boys and the newer conditions of farm
labor which have come out of the employment
of boys.</p>

<p>An instance of what happened in Highland,
New York, will illustrate the power of leadership
on the part of a camp leader and the coöperative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
instinct of a group of city boys who have considerable
familiarity with the principles of strikes,
lockouts, picket duty, and street-corner oratory.
The boys were being paid one and one-half cents
a quart for currant picking. In years past this
had been the usual rate. They could, on the average,
pick about 40 quarts a day, which brought
them $3.60 a week, assuming that they worked
for six days in the week and there was no rain
or other interruptions. Meanwhile each boy's proportion
of the board at camp amounted to about
$3.50 a week. At this point a combination of
training in school debating, listening to speeches
of industrial disturbers, and a knowledge of trade-union
methods came into play, for these boys
gathered together and determined to demand two
cents a quart. They held a meeting and voted to
strike for two cents. They marched around the
berry-storage houses, each wearing an empty berry
basket as a cap, on which was marked "two cents"
and which was decorated more or less artistically
with bunches of currants. A meeting of all farmers
of the district was called by the general camp
supervisor of the district. The boys had presented
their arguments to the individual camp leaders,
and in turn the supervisor presented them to the
farmers. The farmers, in turn, presented their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
difficulties. They said they could not afford to
pay more; talked about middlemen, commission-men,
express rates, greater cost of baskets and
crates, mortgage on the farm, and everything, in
fact, except the federal income tax. But the boys
won out, and the meeting resulted in a new price
never before paid for picking currants. And the
boys who, up to then, had been able to pick only
40 quarts a day, were able to gather many more
after the advance in rate, picking 60 quarts a day
instead of 40 quarts. There are people who can
read into this short story an economic principle.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary to have a clear understanding
between the boy-camp group, through
its leader or the organization sending the camp,
and the individual farmer or the group of farmers
employing the boys, as to fundamental points of
remuneration, type of work expected, length and
permanency of service.</p>

<p>The boy-camp-group problem is wholly different
from the problem of the individual boy who works
for an individual farmer and has no established
relations with any camp. The latter is a contract
relationship between the boy and the farmer. The
farmer usually hires the boy by the month for
general farm work, and the duties incident to such
a job are familiar to everyone. The hours may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
be long or short, the work hard or easy, the food
good or bad, the boy's room clean or unsanitary;
but there is nothing unusual in this problem.</p>

<p>The one which is discussed here is that of the
labor camp, where a group of boys are projected
into a strange community to work at a job unfamiliar
to the majority of them,&mdash;working for a
farmer or a group of farmers who have never
before employed such a type of labor. Any single
employer of farm labor who is in a position to
employ a group of boys may be assumed either
to be conducting a large farm on which there is
a great diversity of crops extending over a wide
range of time of harvesting, or to be a specializing
farmer working in an intensive way on a
comparatively small area with special crops which
are harvested in short periods of time. Perhaps it
may be better to think of three types of jobs, or
rather, three types of employers who have jobs
to be filled by groups of boys.</p>

<p>First, there is the individual farmer who is a specialist.
Such employers grow berries and other small
fruits. Here the boys get very little farm experience.
They do obtain an idea of country life, and they
have excellent camp experience, but in order to
learn much about the fruit and berry business
they ought to be on the farm during the time of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
spraying, pruning, and fertilizing. In reality these
boys are but factory hands under farm conditions.
Of course this type of work is extremely well
adapted to the inexperienced boy.</p>

<p>Second, there is the type of employer represented
by the vegetable grower. In this case it
is readily seen that crops are put into the ground
as early as April, and seeding may continue until
the fifteenth of August, and with weeding, thinning,
and cultivating, the work may continue practically
throughout the season. The harvesting of
certain crops may start late in June and continue
until the ground freezes. In this work the boys
obtain the very best sort of farm experience outside
of that obtained from general farm work.
The work which they do is diversified, and they
learn about many farm operations.</p>

<p>Third, another type of employer is the business
organization made up of farmers; as, for example,
the shippers' or growers' association, where a group
of farmers unite under a more or less compact
organization for the purpose of raising and moving
crops. Another illustration&mdash;somewhat different
for the reason that the organization is not made
up of farmers, but rather is allied with farmers&mdash;is
that of a canning company. In working for such
a type of employer the boy may or may not gain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
considerable agricultural experience, depending entirely
upon whether he is working on diversified
crops for long periods of time or doing specialized
harvesting. It is necessary to keep in mind these
different types of work as represented by different
types of employers.</p>

<p>It is clear that in some sections, under certain
agricultural conditions already described, the job
might be guaranteed a group of boys from the
middle of April until the first of November, with
almost steady work for six days in the week. The
nature of crops and weather conditions determine
continuity of work. A heavy rain means a good deal
of cultivating and weeding immediately afterward in
order to conserve the moisture. A light rain means
that the boys can work for part of the day in the
fields, while in the case of small-fruit farming even
a slight rain prevents the picking of the fruit.
Again, in vegetable farming a boy may work all
day if the fields are not too hot, without any injury
to his health or to the crops, because the vegetable
plants cannot be injured by handling, no matter
how hot it is.</p>

<p>In the case of the specialized farmer, there is
little or no guarantee for work beyond a short and
definite period; that is, the period is necessarily
short, but whether or not it is definite depends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
a great deal upon the weather and prices of crops.
It is obvious that an abundant crop might cause
a low market price,&mdash;a price too low to pay for
picking,&mdash;and employers who early in the season
thought that they wanted a group of boys might
decline to accept them at the last moment. They
might even contract for the boy-labor camp and
after the boys had picked for a few days desire to
drop the whole enterprise because of a fall in
the market price,&mdash;a fall which would not be evident
until the crops commenced to come. Or, again,
the employer might contract for a camp of boys
to pick strawberries, for example, and complete
arrangements might be made for bringing the boys
to the locality, only to have the camp project abandoned
because a week of rain had absolutely ruined
the strawberry crops. Such an experience was met
in New York State the past season. A hailstorm in
Chautauqua County completely destroyed in a few
minutes the prospects of a camp for the harvesting
of tomatoes. Now, it is evident that it is a difficult
matter always to guarantee a job.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Vocational Training of the Military
Training Commission of New York State
requested the zone representatives in the farm-placement
bureaus to see to it that jobs were
guaranteed to boys and that the time of service,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
place of service, and pay should be clearly stated.
It furthermore recommended that the job should
be guaranteed in writing by a single farmer, by a
group of farmers, or by the corporation desiring
these boys; that the employing party should state
the kind of work, the pay, the number of boys
needed, the duration of service, the living conditions,
the provisions made for the food supply for
the first week, and so on. It made it clear that
there should be an assurance in writing of what
the boys were to expect, and that someone should
be delegated to see that the employer lived up to
his agreement. Out of a theory not based upon
any previous experience it was obviously easy to
write up such a statement, but to expect it to be
carried out without a hitch in all parts of the state
and for all kinds of work and all types of employers,
not taking into consideration climatic and market
conditions, to say nothing about the prejudices and
idiosyncrasies of employers and boys, was to count
the chickens before they were hatched. About all
that can be said at this stage of this movement is
in illustration of the way the job guarantee was
handled. In what follows it must be kept in mind
that much of what has been said or what may be
said about the proposition of guaranteeing the job
is not at all difficult to carry out in the case of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
general farming and is only moderately difficult in
the case of vegetable growing.</p>

<p>Every camp failure due to the lack of a workable
contract justifies the original contention that
guaranteeing the job is extremely important.</p>

<p>The right leadership in a camp is very essential.
The camp, after all, is but the lengthened
shadow of its leader. It is not difficult to write the
qualifications essential to leadership in a boys' farm
camp, but it is another matter to find any one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
person who will fill all the conditions that are
peculiar to a labor camp. A hundred-point man
capable of measuring up to the problems involved
in camp leadership must have had experience in
school or Association work. He would have knowledge
of cooking utensils and personal equipment
necessary to take to camp; capacity to arrange
for transportation for the boys by the most direct,
convenient, and economical route; ability to deal
successfully with the problem of the first night in
camp,&mdash;a night when boys cannot or will not
sleep, when they are stirred up by the novelty of
the situation. He would be able to recognize good,
substantial, nourishing food, and to see that the
boys had proper food in such an emergency as the
camp cook's suddenly being taken ill or deserting
his job. He would have had experience in adjusting
working conditions, would know how many quarts
of fruit, for example, the average boy can pick;
would be able to help these boys get the most out
of their work by showing them the most effective
method of harvesting; would understand how to
use first-aid equipment. He would have to see that
the boys kept up correspondence with their homes.
He might have to sit up all night with a boy who
had eaten more fruit than was good for him.</p>

<p>The right leader will also have to think of reading
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
matter for the camp and of the problem of having
the boys attend church services on Sunday when
the membership of the camp has varied religious
beliefs. He may have some orthodox Jews in camp
when the country village has only a Methodist
church. He must satisfy the boys who want to have
a minstrel show, or the townspeople who offer to
entertain the boys. He may even have to arbitrate
in labor disputes. He may be the local placement
bureau. He should be able to drive an automobile,
in order that he may carry a flying squad five miles
from camp for a day's work for a farmer who is in
immediate need. He must be able to answer the
questions asked on blanks sent out by the state
departments of agriculture and education, by city
boards of education, by state Y.M.C.A.'s, by child-labor
bureaus, and by all other organizations more
or less directly interested in the new aspects of
old problems. If the boys have been excused from
school, he must certify that their labor-camp work
has been equivalent to the school work which they
otherwise would have had. He must be the banker
of the camp and help the boys conserve the money
which they earn. He is accountable to the group
for the expenses of the camp, in order that these
may be divided pro rata. He must be able to buy
supplies at the least cost.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>

<p>It is with deliberate intention that this list has
been made lengthy and of wide range, in order to
show that no man exists who could meet adequately
every condition imposed. He is bound to be "born
short," as William Hawley Smith would state it,
on some of these angles. If he is a social-minded
man of the Boy Scout or Y.M.C.A. type, he will
be long on entertainments, recreation, food requirements,
knowledge of personal equipment, group
work, first aid, and sanitation. If he is of the
school-teacher type, he will probably be strong on
discipline, efficient in looking after details of school
credits, camp expenses, records, moral conditions,
letter writing, and keeping boys busy. If he is a
technical man in agriculture, he may know nothing
about baseball on Saturday afternoon or how to
organize a minstrel show, but he will probably
know how to do more than keep boys busy. He
will keep them effectively busy; that is, he will
arrange to have certain boys do the lines of work
adapted to their skill and knowledge. He will discover
ways of utilizing the labor of the unskilled
boy. He will be able to judge whether or not a
boy is working to his full capacity, and he may
be somewhat pitiless if the boy does not measure
up to a farm-labor standard. In other words,
such a man will be very largely interested in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
working camp. He will be interested in meeting the
conditions imposed by the farmers. He will know
that the berries must be expressed by four o'clock
and that the picking may have to stop promptly at
two. He will know that a leaky crate of raspberries
means a low price for possibly a whole carload.
He will be less interested, perhaps, in the balanced
ration and more interested in using the products
of the community on the camp table. He will not
be interested in the records required by school
officials so much as in those expected of him by
the farm-bureau agent. In short, his idea is to promote
agriculture and not to promote the county
Y.M.C.A. movement, the back-to-the-farm movement,
or any other movement which may be allied
with the farm-cadet service.</p>

<p>It is not possible to find any one man who is
socially, pedagogically, and agriculturally minded.
If he claims to be good in all three fields he probably
is mediocre. The experience of the past year,
however, shows some remarkably fine work done
by leaders of boy camps. Some have been public-school
teachers who have given their summer services
for nothing or for a nominal fee. Some have
been released from their duties as Y.M.C.A. secretaries
in order that the association might make a
contribution to the farm-cadet movement. Some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
have been physical directors in public schools.
Some have been scout masters among the Boy
Scouts. Others have been agricultural teachers
who saw that this work was, after all, in the line
of their usual duties.</p>

<p>The following illustrates one of the hundred
things which a camp leader must know about:</p>

<div class="box">
<h2>INSTRUCTIONS TO FARM CADETS ENLISTED FOR CAMP-SQUAD SERVICE IN NEW YORK STATE</h2>

<h3><i>WHAT TO TAKE</i></h3>

<p class="center">NECESSARY ARTICLES</p>

<p>Bed sack 75 × 30 inches (to be stuffed with straw at camp)
or cot mattress; enamel-ware plate, cup, saucer, sauce dish, also
knife, fork, and spoon; dinner pail or box, two heavy blankets,
small pillow, working clothes, sweater, gymnasium shirt, raincoat
or old overcoat, heavy shoes, toothbrush, tooth powder, small
mirror, towels, extra socks, rubbers or rubber boots, extra underwear,
hairbrush, comb, soap, handkerchiefs, pajamas, a good
disposition, and a spirit of loyalty to the camp and its aims.</p>

<p class="center">DESIRABLE ARTICLES</p>

<p>Musical instruments, camera, baseball, glove, bat, needles,
thread, safety pins, notebook, pencils, writing paper, envelopes,
good books, magazines.</p>
</div>

<p>The methods of housing the boys differ widely.
Ordinarily one thinks of tents as being the most
feasible, but the scarcity and high cost of such
equipment during the past year prevented the boys
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
from living under canvas. Generally speaking, it
would be better to think in terms of something
more permanent than tents, as these do not last
more than three years, and if the camp idea of harvesting
crops by the use of boys is to continue,&mdash;and
many believe it will,&mdash;it is advisable to plan
for a permanent and inexpensive type of building.
A rough board shack with a good roof is highly desirable
in the early spring days and in the late fall.</p>

<p>Many of the cadets in New York State camps
were quartered in berry houses (which are really
packing and storage houses located in the berry
fields), in vacant houses, in schoolhouses, in grange
halls, and in buildings located on the fair grounds.
Most of these berry houses were two stories high,
the first floor being used for the commissary department
and the second floor for dormitories. In
such cases the berries were packed in temporary
shacks adjoining the berry houses. In other cases
the boys have used the first floor for a sitting
room and built a rough shack back of the berry
or storage house for kitchen and dining room.</p>

<p>One of the most significant camping places was
that of a two-room schoolhouse, where cots for fifty
boys were put into the rooms, and the basement was
used as a kitchen. The boys built a table outside
and put up a canopy over it for a dining room.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
They next dammed up a brook which ran back
of the schoolhouse and made what they termed a
"bathtub," which was capable of holding about six
boys at a time. They also put into fine condition
the rather disreputable schoolhouse latrines. These
boys made the schoolhouse ring at night with their
popular school songs; the old piano did its best to
bring together the heritages of the East Side and
of the Highlands of the Hudson.</p>

<p>There are several ways of making provision for
camp equipment. One is to develop, under state,
county, or local auspices, a series of permanent
camp quarters located in small-fruit, large-fruit, and
muck-land districts. This equipment need not be
expensive. It will be located very near the source
of labor demand and can always be used, whether
boy or adult labor is employed. Fruit and produce
growers and kindred establishments have in the
past provided, more or less, for such an equipment.</p>

<p>Another plan is to use schoolhouses, grange halls,
vacant farm buildings, and agricultural-fair equipment.
It is unfortunate that so much property ordinarily
used for public purposes lies idle for long
periods of time. Some may say that the city boy
will not leave country property in good shape, but
experience so far has shown that the city boys
have left things better than they found them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>Still another type already spoken of is tentage,
and perhaps the best way to provide such an equipment
is to have the state furnish it through the
adjutant general's office.</p>

<p>The sanitary aspects of any type of camp are highly
important. In Massachusetts the committee of public
safety, which established boy camps, required
that the sanitary conditions of these camps should
be inspected by the board of health, and the committee
furnished full directions and a blue print
for the building of a sanitary latrine.</p>

<p>Some of the camps burn their garbage in home-made
incineration plants.</p>

<p>Ordinary garden hose with a watering-pot sprinkler
attachment, or an elevated barrel with a sprayer
attached, and filled by the use of a pail and ladder,
were shower-bath devices worked out by the boys
in various camps.</p>

<p>All the camps devised some method of keeping
food cool, ranging from those that had a real city
ice chest down to those that cleaned out a spring
and set in it a bottomless, covered box.</p>

<p>The job of feeding boys in camp is not a sinecure.
Every scheme has been tried, from engaging at a
salary of one hundred dollars a month a Pullman
dining-car chef down to, or shall it be said up to,
a boy cook. The cook problem in a labor camp is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
as difficult to handle as is the so-called "servant"
problem of the city. The average cook knows more
about cooking than he does about dietetics. He
is very likely to lack adaptability. He is usually
untrained for camp cooking and is not particularly
open to suggestions. Experience seems to
show that the best cook is the one who has done
work in a Y.M.C.A. camp or in a Boy Scout camp.
Of course, this year there was a great scarcity of the
latter class to be found, as they were needed in their
own organizations, and therefore many camps were
obliged to employ a local woman of the matronly
type to cook for the boys; sometimes an experienced
camp leader has developed some good cooks among
the boys in camp. Perhaps the best results, however,
were obtained from boys who before the opening
of camps were given from two to four weeks of
camp-cooking instruction in the school system from
which they came. These boys were ready to use the
products of the localities, such as peas, beans, tomatoes,
radishes, lettuce, and corn, while the professional
cook often seemed more familiar with the use
of the can opener.</p>

<p>The quantity and variety of food was practically
in the hands of the boys themselves, assuming
that the cook was a good one. If the allowance
of fruit for breakfast, for example, consisted of four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
prunes or one banana or half an orange, and the
group as a whole desired a larger portion, it was
perfectly possible for them to secure it by so
voting, for it must be remembered that the food
expense of the camps was divided pro rata among
the boys. Under these conditions, however, it was
found that the boys were very economical and
frowned upon the few malcontents who wanted to
gorge themselves.</p>

<p>The cafeteria style of serving prevailed generally.</p>

<p>Providing amusements in recreation camps is
always a problem, but farm cadets require little in
the way of entertainment after eight or ten hours of
field service. Camp-fire talks on agriculture, corn
roasts, toasting marshmallows, giving musical entertainments
and minstrel shows, holding mock trials,
playing baseball on Saturday afternoons or Sundays,
constitute the chief forms of recreation. In every
instance the lads have been well received in the
local communities. They were popular features at
church entertainments, Red Cross benefits, and
country sociables. Often the boys, especially in
the berry-picking regions, went swimming about
4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, after the crates had been sent by the
afternoon express.</p>

<p>In every instance the village church and the
county Y.M.C.A. took an active interest in the farm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
cadets. Many of the boys played musical instruments,
and their confidence in themselves was contributory
to many supplementary boy choirs. The
country pastors evidently made it a point to do
what they could for the pleasure of all the boys, and
without exception there seemed to be no religious
distinctions. In some camps the Catholic priest
expressed his fatherly feeling for the lads. In
others the Jewish and Catholic boys attended the
union village church. In brief, the boys entered into
the spirit of the rural life, and both the country folk
and the youth of the city were the better for it.</p>

<p>A study of the different camps in operation in
various parts of the country seems to indicate that
they might be grouped under six heads as follows.</p>

<p>I. <i>Concentration, or training, camps.</i> These are
usually located in agriculturally strategic sections
of the state, where boys may receive preliminary
training in camp life and in farm work under disciplinary
and instructional conditions. Of course
such a camp can do nothing more than give the
boys a training in the elements of farm activities
(such as harnessing a horse, running a hand cultivator,
using a hoe, driving a team) and serve as a
trying-out period for weeding out boys who are
unsatisfactory. These camps cannot be considered
places which will give a preliminary agricultural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
education, for that is very different from giving
a preliminary idea of farm operations. After these
boys have received a course of such training, they
are sent out under leadership to work in a section
of the state where a group may work for one
farmer and live at the camp meanwhile or may
work for individual farmers and live with the employer.
Obviously it is taken for granted that such
a camp is located in a good agricultural section
and that its surroundings have something more
than fine swimming holes or beautiful scenery.
These boys must be trained in an environment and
under conditions similar to the farm life in which
they are to participate later. It would seem that
the agricultural colleges of the country and the
secondary schools of agriculture would, generally
speaking, offer splendid locations for establishing
training camps. Here would be found, or ought
to be found, good land. This is not always true,
because occasionally an agricultural college has
been located irrespective of good land. The technical
and dormitory facilities, however, would be
available for the boys in training.</p>

<p>II. <i>Farm-working, or labor-distributing, camps.</i>
These are concentration camps in a certain sense,
but they are located directly in the farm district
where the boys, after receiving their preliminary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
training, are to find work in the community adjoining
the camp. Several camps of this order have
started out with the idea of giving a preliminary
training in agriculture in the camp itself, and have
borrowed or bought farming implements and teams
and leased land in order to give the training. But
in the majority of cases this idea was abandoned,
for it was found that these boys could receive all
their preliminary training with the farmers, provided
the leader of the camp could establish helpful
relations between the boy and the employing
farmer and could, out of his wisdom and experience,
protect the boy in the early stages of the
work and guide him in all its stages. In other
words, in this type of camp a city man, acting
as leader, comes into a community with a group
of boys who live at the camp but receive their
training with the near-by farmers. A labor-supply
camp, composed of able-bodied boys, is a type which
adequately meets the need at small expense.</p>

<p>III. <i>Military farm-training camp.</i> This is a type
of camp where city boys, under the direction of a
school or some organization, go into a farming community
and open up new land which otherwise
would not have been put under cultivation. These
boys stay at the camp during the season. They
do not work for the farmers near by, or, at least,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
not ordinarily,&mdash;the intention being to establish
a self-supporting and self-maintaining camp for the
use of the boys who attend. The land is tilled,
the seed planted, and the harvest gathered for the
benefit of the boys. Any profits are given to the
boys or to the school, and any expenses for conducting
the camp, or overhead charges, usually
come out of the organization or school represented.
It is questionable whether, generally speaking, this
type of camp is on a sound economic and agricultural
basis. If such a camp could be carried on
for a number of years with a strong school or
other organization behind it, and plenty of capital,
it is very likely that it would succeed. It takes
capital to establish good soil conditions and purchase
tools, farm machinery, and stock, and to put
up buildings. It is a highly desirable type of camp
to consider in terms of many years or where a
school wishes to give its boys a military and farm
experience. But in the food emergency through
which the country is now passing, it is doubtful if
this type of camp should ever have been started.
It is, however, an excellent type to establish as a
permanent adjunct to a city school system.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Coöperative camp where the boys share in
proceeds.</i> This type of camp is practically like III,
and if the farm land is new and the camp leader
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
is untrained in agricultural operations and the boys
are unskilled, it is about as likely to be doomed
to failure as is the other.</p>

<p>V. <i>The village- or country-school type of camp.</i>
This is a camp where the schoolboys, under the
leadership of a teacher, go to the outskirts of the
village and develop a garden. If the land is good
and the teacher knows agriculture and the boys
attend to business, they will most certainly receive
an excellent practical training useful to them in
life. They will have learned how to work in the
soil, how to work together for a common purpose,
how to stick to a job until it is finished, how to
look ahead from the time seed is purchased until
the crop is placed in the hands of the customer.
All these things are good and they are useful to any
boy, but, of course, from the standpoint of increasing
the food supply in any large way through the
growing of wheat, feed corn, oats, rye, buckwheat,
potatoes, and large fruits there is little to be said.
The work is to be commended on the basis of its
value to the individual boy.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Short-term camp, sometimes called "flying
squadron".</i> This type of camp is advisable only in
an intensive-farming region where quick service
for the harvesting period is needed. The squad
itself will serve to keep a balance between the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
demand for labor and the supply. It is easy to
picture a fruit region around and through which
are a number of camps. Each one ought to be
working to the limit, but, of course, as a matter
of fact in one section there would be a greater demand
for boys than could be met by the local
camp. It is at this time that the flying squadron
comes in, when, in response to the SOS call, a group
of temporarily idle boys from one camp may be sent
to another camp which is short of help.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>A SUMMARIZED PROGRAM OF ACTION</small></h2>

<p>Out of this war we are going to have a new spirit
and method in education. England has already begun
to evaluate its present system. It has issued
a report on the assistance which education, if properly
directed, can give to industry and commerce
after the war. The results of a recent investigation
afford&mdash;so the report states&mdash;a convincing proof
of the necessity of improving and extending the
provisions hitherto made for instruction and training
in scientific studies as a necessary foundation
for fruitful research.</p>

<p>The report goes on to say that, in a sense unknown
to former generations, England has become
a part of Europe; and in the interest not merely of
commerce but of the intelligent conduct of national
affairs an adequate knowledge of the languages&mdash;and,
through the languages, of the literatures, histories,
and civilizations of European countries&mdash;should
be in the possession of a far larger proportion
of its population than in the past. It states
that particular subjects of instruction in the high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
schools and institutes cannot be divorced from the
consideration of their organization and of their curricula
as a whole, if a proper balance of studies is
to be secured and if higher education is to be truly
liberal and humane in its spirit and influence. It
insists that access to the schools must be rendered
easier for native ability wherever it is found,
and affirms again and again that the needs of
the nation cannot be satisfied merely by changes
affecting higher education or by a provision of educational
facilities confined to scholars of special gifts
and abilities. It closes by saying that the future
will make new and increased demands, especially
in a democratic community, on the health, character,
and intelligence of every citizen; and these
demands can only be met by comprehensive and
far-reaching improvements and developments of
elementary education.</p>

<p>The individual-industrial-efficiency idea which we
obtained from Germany will have to be interpreted
in America not for military purposes, but in terms
of personal and vocational service for the nation.
Just as the academic militarism of the Old World
has been found wanting and has been gradually
transformed into the mobilization of all forces behind
the lines on an entirely new basis and conception
of what may be done by a people in time of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
war, so we in this country shall learn that we may
in times of peace, through efficient and effective
living, prepare for defense. In this preparation we
may learn that improved elementary education, that
vocational training, that bringing into the schools
the Boy Scout spirit, that teaching of sanitation and
personal hygiene, that organizing our courses on a
unit and project basis, that developing systems of
student service in school life, that extending school
facilities to adults, and a hundred other things which
have been thought of as fads and pedagogical idiosyncrasies
will, to quote the New York State law
relative to military equivalents, "specifically prepare
for service useful to the state in the maintenance
of defense, in the promotion of public safety, in
the conservation and development of the state's
resources, or in the construction and maintenance
of public improvements." Truly, a program for
peace as well as for war.</p>

<p>The school board and its executive officer, the
superintendent, should do everything to save the
school buildings for school purposes. They are literally
factories turning out, it is hoped, handmade
products; and in time of war their service should
be increased rather than diminished. To use them
as hospitals will be a mistake,&mdash;better by far confiscate
department stores. Bring the war into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
schools in the spirit already interpreted in preceding
chapters, but do not take the schools into the war.</p>

<p>Do not eliminate studies indiscriminately. Evaluate
if you will,&mdash;and this is always well,&mdash;but
wholesale cutting out is to be avoided. It may be
that the cost and value of instruction in freehand
drawing will have to be compared with the permanent
value of the study of Latin. It may be that
instead of adding to the vocational department a
machine-shop equipment, which is always expensive,
it will be discovered that a coöperative course can
be developed, employing the equipment of a neighboring
factory, and that all the school need furnish
is a teacher for blackboard work in mathematics,
drawing, and science. It is likely that a longer
school day will be advisable and also a longer school
year. It is quite probable that the introduction of
the methods of the Boy Scout movement into the
public schools will be found superior to some of
the present teaching of nature study, recreational
work, civics, and conduct.</p>

<p>Provision must be made for filling the places of
the male teachers who will be drafted. Many of
these will be instructors in science and mathematics.
It ought to be possible to secure the services
of retired civil or mechanical engineers for
teaching these subjects. It is feasible to draft into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
service married women who have once taught. It
is to be hoped that the government will eventually
recognize that educational enterprise as well
as industrial enterprise ought to furnish grounds
for exemption. As war comes closer to us provision
must be made for keeping the schools open
twelve months in the year, and from eight in the
morning until ten at night for six days in the week.
Every child up to the age of 14 must be kept in
school. It is the best place for him, provided, of
course, the school rises to its full height,&mdash;and it
is taken for granted that it will. The physical
condition of the younger children especially should
be watched very carefully. The teacher should discover
the conditions at home. It may be that some
pupils have had no breakfast and are not likely to
have a suitable lunch or even a supper. Some
will have to be fed in the schools, and here is an
opportunity for the older girls in domestic-science
classes. Some will report certain home conditions
that will require that the school make a report to
the local Red Cross chapter or some other relief
agency. Again there is opportunity for the older
girls to serve through their knowledge of home
nursing, infant feeding, and first aid.</p>

<p>If the war strikes us hard, we may have to think
of part-time work for children above 14, but we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
must never let the children get away from us as
they have in England. We must control the exodus.
We must not abrogate the existing compulsory-attendance
laws and the existing labor laws. We
must not interpret these laws with laxity and shut
our eyes while the children go by us on their way
to work. We may do well to amend these laws
if in so doing we can incorporate useful labor into
the educative process. In other words, we must be
constructive in any part-time measures which are
adopted. The educative value of profitable labor
need not be lost.</p>

<p>It will be well for us to look into the real
value of military training for schoolboys before
we adopt in a wholesale fashion obsolete militarism.
The value of wooden-gunism is questionable.
Physical training, vocational training, athletics, Boy
Scout work, team play, and discipline are far more
valuable. Military drill given in addition to these
activities may be advisable. However, on this point
there is still a difference of opinion. But to give
formal military instruction without considering its
adaptability to the methods used in modern warfare
and the training incident to effective preparation
for them is neither military preparedness
on the one hand nor sensible educational procedure
on the other.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

<p>School boards ought to organize at once vocational
courses to secure state and national aid, and
seek from the legislature state aid for directors of
community gardens, as, from now on, these will be
a permanent feature of community life. Some sort
of provision ought to be made relative to bringing
agriculture into the city school or taking the
city boy to agriculture. A country branch of a
city school is possible. Play and recreation centers
must be developed. The increase of juvenile offenses
in both England and France during this war has
been tremendous. Many of these offenses are committed
by children who are still at school. There
is much evidence that owing to the absence of military
service of their fathers,&mdash;and, perhaps even
more, of their elder brothers,&mdash;the industrial employment
of their mothers, the darkened streets, and
other circumstances, many school children are suffering
from the lack of proper care and discipline and
are exposed to serious risks of deterioration. These
conditions have been mitigated through the establishment
of evening play centers, which provide the
children with suitable occupation and amusement
after school hours.</p>

<p>The principal of a school can play a large part
in a war-emergency program. He can develop the
idea of War Savings among the children in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
school. Announcement has been made that the
government intends to develop the War Savings
Certificate plan of England. These certificates are
perhaps better adapted to persons of small means
than a Liberty Bond. The United States Treasury
Department has set forth a plan for advertising and
selling these certificates through the public schools
of the nation. The aim is to have every pupil an
owner of a "little baby bond" and a participant in
a democratic plan of government security. A campaign
for thrift has been started. The schools must
do their part.</p>

<p>The principal can organize patriotic meetings at
which he can explain the purposes of the Red
Cross, the Liberty Loan, and the garden and conservation
movements. He can distribute pamphlets
relating to war service. In a small community he
can be the leader of the Red Cross movement, only
he must always remember that he is to work with
state and national organizations and is not to write
to Washington when he can perhaps step across
the street to local headquarters or write directly to
state headquarters. Of course, he will follow closely
the printed directions with reference to bandages,
shipping, etc., for the general organization has put
more thought into it and gained more experience
than he could possibly gather.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>Obviously the principal ought to allow no competition
between school organizations and local organizations.
If the local organization is strong and
effective, he ought to work under it. If it is not,
he may well work over it. By all means he should
inform pupils of the meaning of the war, that they
in turn may carry word to their parents; and such
work is not always limited to districts where people
are foreign born. There may be as much need
for such work in the West as in New York City.
A Western farmer is reported as saying that he
did not care who owned the country or whether
the Germans took it or not so long as he sold
his wheat crop.</p>

<p>The principal may direct a state census on some
particular data for which state authorities may call.
He should bring together various bulletins issued
by state and national governments which concern
food production and conservation, sanitation, public
health, nursing, dietetics, etc., and by publishing lists
of such material in newspapers and posting them
on school bulletin boards, bring the information
within them to the people who need it most. He
should make the hall exercises in the school mean
more than ever. Let us hope that "America" may
be sung with more vim, and that the principal will
know the second stanza. The "Marseillaise" and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
other national songs of our allies may be sung. Of
course a service flag made by the girls in the school
hangs prominently in the assembly hall, and each
of its stars speaks for a teacher, a student, or a
graduate who represents the life-giving contribution
of the school to the cause of democracy.</p>

<p>The country-school principal has a great deal to
do. His work differs from that of the city principal
in that he may be a recognized leader in almost
everything, while the city principal must necessarily
coöperate with individuals and organizations. The
principal in the open country can be the local
agent for seed and fertilizer and for the distribution
of farmers' bulletins. In fact, he may be the local
representative for the state departments of education,
of agriculture, of labor, and of health.</p>

<p>He ought to use judgment in excusing boys from
school for farm work. He will know the exact circumstances
under which a boy goes to work. He
will know whether he is working on his father's
farm or that of a neighbor. He can help that boy
with his lessons so that he can do some studying
at home and keep up with his classes. And in
the late fall, when the boys return to school from
their farm work, he can organize a special class
in order that they may satisfactorily make up
their studies. This extra work on his part and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
that of his coworkers will make one of the answers
to the call to the colors which comes to every man
and woman in this country.</p>

<p>A city principal can organize an agricultural
course in his city school, and obtain a state-aided
teacher for giving agricultural theory in the winter
in connection with biological science, and have this
teacher take a group of boys into the country in
the spring. He can always think of his boys as
going out to farm work on the basis of an organized
group, and on that basis only. A teacher from
his school might go with these boys and serve as
their leader. It is probable that educational experiments
of this nature will lead eventually to country
branches of city schools.</p>

<p>It is clear that the industrial and trade schools,
because of the very nature of their purpose, may
render unusual service, but they must start out
with the idea that they are to take their directions
from the state boards of control of vocational
education rather than go off at a tangent independent
of any state or national movement. It
must be remembered that provision has been made
for a national system of vocational education with
a Federal Board of Vocational Education guiding
it, and that every state board having charge of
vocational education is working in conjunction with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
the national board. We must keep in mind that
the Federal Board of Vocational Education is in
close touch with the National Council of Defense
at Washington, and consequently with all departments
of the national government which concern
war measures. For a local school to jeopardize its
chances for national and state aid through failure
to follow a program provided by these authorities,
or to develop types of work which are out of accord
with national needs, will not be the part of wisdom
or common sense. These schools must not forget
that their primary function is to make mechanics
and not army supplies, but if they are called upon
to do the latter work, or if they can do it effectively,
they must make it educational in its aim and not
merely productive work.</p>

<p>State officials ought to have inventories made
of the equipment of the vocational schools, with
a census of the experience and training of the
instructors, and a state study ought to be made
of plans to train workers for the different branches
needed. Such a study would point out how the
semiskilled may become skilled, how the unskilled
may become semiskilled, how the necessary training
may be given to specialist tool makers, and
how there can be developed a type of industrial
work suitable for women and girls.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>The directors of trade schools will provide opportunities
for the training of foremen in evening
classes, or at other times if necessary, using methods
of instruction which will increase their skill in dealing
with green help or unskilled laborers. These
men will adjust the evening schools to run the year
round, and also provide for off-time classes.</p>

<p>In vocational schools of the commercial order,
of which we have very few in the country, provision
will be made for short-unit courses in commercial
practice for women and girls to fit them
to take the place of men drafted.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, it is very likely that
the day vocational schools will have comparatively
few pupils during the war period, as young persons
who ordinarily go to these schools will have readily
obtained work in factories. However, such youth
can still be instructed if the school will go to the
factory and there establish training courses.</p>

<p>The present is a good time to develop commercial
courses which have a vocational purpose,
and which have methods more in accord with the
definition of vocational training. The commercial
departments in the majority of our high schools
rather indifferently train stenographers, typists, and
clerks. They do not even attempt to train salesmen
and saleswomen, index and statistical clerks,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
comptometer operators, etc. Very few of the commercial
courses have either the definiteness of aim
of the industrial and trade schools or the practical
contact with actual commercial practice which will
be necessary if they are to meet the requirements
of modern business. Commercial schools have not
yet caught the spirit of part-time, off-time, or short-unit
programs.</p>

<p>The manual-training teacher will find plenty to
do; that is, if the state departments of education
furnish him definite data and specifications for war-emergency
work. It will be practically useless for
him to carry on special work in any large way
unless the field of service of the boy workers is
organized in some such way as is the Red Cross
work. If boxes are needed for packing supplies, a
working drawing of the same ought to be furnished
by the state department. If hospital furniture, such
as bed racks and tables, is needed, the articles
should be standardized in order that they may be
made in quantities and may be serviceable when
they reach the source of need. The same is true
of splints. The reason for the great accomplishment
of the French and Canadian boys in the making of
splints used temporarily on the field of service is
that they have been furnished with very definite
directions as to size, material, and method of making.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>

<p>It cannot be too emphatically stated that the
war-service work of the elementary and secondary
schools needs definite direction from the state departments
of education if the unity of effort based
upon directions common to all are to result not
only in effective work but also in fulfilling the social
and civic purposes which are behind the service.</p>

<p>This is an opportune time for the manual-training
teacher to abandon his set of models. They should
have been set aside long ago. His war-service
duties will give an additional motive for socializing
his work. In small cities and villages where there is
plenty of land available for cultivation the director
of manual training, on the first of May, ought to
change his title and assume his duties as director
of community gardens. He should have been preparing
for this work by giving instruction in garden
work in the manual-training room during March
and April. Meanwhile he should have interested
adults of the community in the plan of a garden
where both old and young might work, and should
have brought together civic forces to accomplish the
purpose&mdash;a purpose which is educational, social,
recreational, and useful.</p>

<p>Dealing with boys under fifteen, as the average
manual-training teacher will, it is possible for him
to develop a type of manual arts which will serve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
to create or arouse a set of industrial interests
helpful to the boy in determining his life career.
With every temptation to a pupil to leave school,
the manual-training teacher will now have an unusual
opportunity to make his work so attractive
and economically so helpful that the boy may see
the advantage of paying no attention to industrial-service
inducements.</p>

<p>This is a time for increasing the field of usefulness
of the industrial arts in connection with the
problems involved in the junior high school. This
type of school is certain to meet with increased
favor during and after the war, and the reasons are
both educational and administrative.</p>

<p>So much has already been said in several places
in this book about the service which cooking and
sewing teachers may render, that it is hardly
necessary in this place to do more than give a
very brief summary. As supplies for cooking lessons
become more expensive, the cooking teacher
must make more of demonstrations to pupils, and
less, perhaps, of actual practice. The war recipes
which she uses must be mimeographed or printed
and given the pupils to take home. She must organize
classes for adults in unit courses and hold
them afternoons and evenings. In fact, she might
well have the mothers come with the children
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
during the regular session and receive some special
instructions which the children receive. She will be
busy the year round; her larger work will begin
when the schools close, in that she will start her
canning and community-club work. A situation
can easily be conceived wherein she will have in
reality very little teaching responsibility in the
classroom. She will be looked upon as the community
organizer for all types of food conservation,
and some of her older girls will, in all probability,
be teaching in the regular classes. Of
course, she will interest all the children in the
school in saving bottles, jars, crocks, large-mouthed
bottles, tumblers, small wooden pails, etc. for containers
for the jams, preserves, and fruit juices
which will be put up. She will obtain all the new
bulletins on processes of drying and dehydrating.
Perhaps she may have initiative enough to discover
a fruit crop which will not be picked except
through her efforts. Perhaps she will find an
orphan asylum in the community filled with boys
and girls who can pick this fruit crop.</p>

<p>The sewing teacher has more than enough to
do. If the Red Cross chapter does not keep her
busy, then she can keep the chapter active. With
the price of materials as high as it is now and
the quality as poor, there is plenty of opportunity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
to look over, in every home, the last year's wardrobe.
She might organize a Thrift Club. Enthusiastic
youth will do almost anything under the
name of "club."</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that every girl in the school
above the age of ten will enroll in the sewing
class and not sit idly by while a few do all the
work. Very likely the household-arts teacher will
organize a home-cadet unit, just as the boys
will be organized into farm-cadet units. The
girls will have their pledge of loyalty and perhaps
will wear their chevrons, badges, or buttons,
and will enroll for specific work in food, clothing,
or shelter projects.</p>

<p>The agricultural teacher will have more than he
can do. An effective teacher in normal periods is
always busy with his supervision of home-project
work, preparation of material for classroom teaching,
gathering of laboratory exhibits, etc. But in
war time he must carry on his shoulders still larger
burdens. In the early spring he will discontinue
his formal agricultural teaching to the special vocational
group and broaden his work to include those
who have not regularly enrolled in the agricultural
course. To the latter he will give some very definite
suggestions for immediate use on the farm; while
the boys who have been with him all winter will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
be excused from school to give their entire time to
their home projects. To those who have recently
come into the class there will be given special work
in the classroom which they may practice outside
of school hours and which they can follow for full
time during the summer.</p>

<p>He will have a good deal to do with the farm-cadet
idea, and in the winter he will doubtless be
thinking of the type of camp which he will establish
or with which he will be connected. He
may decide that he can do best by organizing a
labor-distributing camp on his own initiative, or
that he will serve as an assistant at the state-farm
training camp, or that he will take his boys,
if they are village boys, to the outskirts of the
village and establish a coöperative camp; or he
may get in touch with the teacher of biology in
a city school and offer the country schoolhouse
and his services for a training camp made up of
city boys. It is assumed that he is in close touch
with the county farm agent; perhaps he is the
local representative of the club work which the
United States Department of Agriculture is promoting;
and, of course, he is taking the responsibility
of acting as agent in his territory for the
United States Boys' Working Reserve,&mdash;a really
wonderful organization full of immense possibilities.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

<p>This Boys' Working Reserve movement started
under the auspices of the United States Department
of Labor in coöperation with the Council of
National Defense, for the purpose of mobilizing
young men between the ages of 16 and 21 for
productive labor in the war emergency.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1917 the Reserve confined
its activities principally to giving federal recognition
to those youths who, as members of state organizations,
had worked at least three weeks on farms or
in food production. At present it is organized in
40 states and in the District of Columbia. Recently
it has extended its activities to include industrial
occupations. Each boy who is physically fit and
who, with the consent of his parents, has taken the
oath of service, is enrolled as a recruit and given
an enrollment button and a certificate bearing the
great seal of the United States. When he has
worked faithfully and capably for the stated period,
he is awarded a federal bronze badge of honor.</p>

<p>After January 1, 1918, thirty-six days of eight
hours each are to be required on the farm or in food
production in order to earn the badge. In industrial
occupations the boy will be required to work at
least sixty days of eight hours in some occupation
considered essential in helping the nation in the
conduct of the war, in order to receive recognition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<p>The national director, Mr. William E. Hall, encourages
every boy to remain in school and in spare
time to pursue some vocational training to make
himself capable of performing a productive war
service, in the expectation that he will be awarded
a badge of honor when he has actually entered an
essential occupation. It is expected that we shall
soon see a registered army of young men ordinarily
not available, which may be used to fill the
gaps in the labor ranks caused by war activities.</p>

<p>The Reserve has been indorsed by President
Wilson in the following language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Permit me to express my great appreciation of the work
undertaken by the United States Boys' Working Reserve of
the Employment Service of Department of Labor. To give
to the young men between the ages of 16 and 21 the privilege
of spending their spare time in productive enterprise
without interrupting their studies at school, while their older
brothers are battling in the trenches and on the seas, must
greatly increase the means of providing for the forces at
the front and the maintenance of those whose services are
needed here. It is a high privilege, no less than a patriotic
duty, to help support the nation by devoted and intelligent
work in this great crisis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt, in writing of the good work
which the Reserve is doing, says, in part:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am glad that you intend to encourage the training of
the boys to prepare for some essential industry where they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
can take the place of a man called to the front. One of the
great benefits you confer is that of making the boy realize
that he is part of Uncle Sam's team; that he is doing his
share in this great war; that he holds his services in trust
for the nation; and that though it is proper to consider the
question of material gain and the question of his own desires,
yet that what he must most strongly consider at this time
is where his services will do most good to our people as
a whole.</p></blockquote>

<p>The teachers of America, as well as the boys, are
making themselves a part of Uncle Sam's team;
and they too hold their services in trust for the
nation. The Junior Red Cross movement in the
schools has swept the country. The school children
have advertised and sold bonds of the second Liberty
Loan.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> The teachers of cooking are serving as local
representatives for the food administrator at Washington.
Agricultural teachers have pledged themselves
as community workers for the summer of
1918. Manual-training teachers are developing plans
for substituting garden projects in the spring for
the manual-training models of the schoolroom.
Technical colleges and institutes are filled with
students in uniform. Industrial and trade schools
on the seacoast are planning to discard their house
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
carpentry for shipbuilding courses. County superintendents
of schools are studying government bulletins
for the last word in preserving and drying
farm products on a large scale, in order that they
may give directions to the schools. Teachers in
academic schools have enlisted for service on relief,
loan, garden, thrift, and conservation committees.
Men who were leaders and supervisors of farm-cadet
camps in 1917 are planning for similar work
in the future on a larger and improved basis. Programs
for teachers' institutes and state associations
of teachers now include the topics: "What can our
schools do in war time?" and "Our schools after
the war."</p>

<p>These efforts of the teachers and the pupils respond
to our President's appeal that each of us
must do his share in making the world safe for
democracy.</p>

<p>At present, to be sure, we center our thoughts
on how to make the world safe for democracy. But
what of the future? What of the contribution of
the schools after the war? Should not the schools
then center their aims and methods on making
<i>democracy safe for the world</i>? If the people themselves
are to be masters, must they not be provided
with an education making for mastership? Is it
not well for us to examine our present schools to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
determine whether they are making a democracy
which will be safe for the world? Have we a system
of education which actually gives an opportunity for
every child to make the most of himself? Have we
a liberalized course of study which actually stimulates
and develops intellectual and aesthetic interests
in music, art, literature, science, travel, and history?
Have we evolved a socialized education developing
moral habits, civic incentives, possession and use of
ethical ideals and standards for a successful group
life? Has our formative process been able to bring
about refinements of social behavior beyond the
point required for group participation? Have we
arrived at the point where we can say that our
people have even the common culture which it is
expected all members of a democracy shall possess,
to say nothing about the development of individual
culture, which is a possession of the interested individual
and his congenial fellows? How far have
we gone in recognizing that "by-education" which
comes through a child's self-direction of his natural
or spontaneous learning instincts and impulses?</p>

<p>How much have we accomplished in giving educational
and vocational guidance to children between
the ages of 12 and 16? What has been
done in the way of fulfilling the national obligation
to teach the strangers within our gates our language
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
and the principles and forms of our civic life? What
has been our program for subnormals in order that
they may be prepared for independent living in
the competitive social order? Have we established
clear-cut distinctions between subnormal and crippled
cases that must remain custodial and those that can
be prepared for independent existence? What are
we doing in the way of education for delinquents?
To what extent have we utilized the discovery that
these antisocial manifestations of youth are results
of heredity, or of inferior homes, or of a lack of
playgrounds, or of poor schools?</p>

<p>Have the schools missed a great opportunity for
giving moral, civic, and physical training to youth
by failing to absorb the Boy Scout and Camp Fire
Girl movements and thus failing to grasp the full
educational significance of the methods adopted by
those who so well understand adolescent youth?
Are the disciplinary methods of the teachers and
the general internal management of the schools such
as will develop among pupils a democracy which is
safe even in the schoolroom? What have we done
in determining what is desirable and feasible for
extending general education to average adults who
have early entered upon specialized occupations?</p>

<p>How far have we gone in our program of vocational
education to recognize and to provide for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
the influence of automatic machinery upon the
physical, mental, and vocational welfare of workers?
Have we so thoroughly grasped the idea of an educational
democracy that no child in our schools is
disadvantaged by the section of the state or of the
country in which he happens to be born?</p>

<p>Have we in our vocational training set up any
program for the industrial training of women which
recognizes that the modern problem of women's
work concerns the following of some productive
vocation away from home? Have we even begun
to realize that every person should have definite
vocational training with such distinctive purpose
back of it that it will produce the skill, knowledge,
ideals, and general experience that function
in distinct callings?</p>

<p>Have we even thought of a program of education
for leisure which will develop enduring tastes and
interests established toward the enrichment of the
individual and indirectly of social life? Do we fully
understand that to make democracy safe for the
world all people should have some leisure or time
apart from vocational, civic, and physical necessities
of life, that such leisure should be filled with sociability,
amusement, recreation, and satisfaction of the
aesthetic and physical desires, and that the public
schools must in some measure provide for these?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span></p>

<p>Will a democracy proclaiming equality of opportunity
as its ideal require an education which
unites from the beginning of the child's school
life, and for all pupils of the school, learning and
social application, ideas and practice, work and
recognition of the meaning of what is done? Or
can a democracy be developed by dividing the
public-school system into parts, one of which pursues
traditional methods with incidental improvements,
and another in which children "learn
through their hands" and are given only the
"essential features" of the traditional bookwork?</p>

<p>All that the schools are now doing in war time,
and much more which they are not yet doing, to
make the world safe for democracy, may be effectively
used after war time to make democracy safe
for the world.

<h2>ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>BOOKS OF WAR-TIME INTEREST</h2>

<p>Upon the schools falls in great measure the responsibility
of training and fitting the nation for service. To support the
schools in fulfilling this tremendous duty is the purpose of
the two following books.</p>

<p>OUR SCHOOLS IN WAR TIME&mdash;AND AFTER</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Arthur D. Dean</span>, Professor of Vocational Education, Teachers College,
Columbia University, and Supervising Officer, Bureau of Vocational
Training, New York State Military Training Commission. 335 pages, $1.25.</p></blockquote>

<p>A book to challenge the spirit of every loyal American. It describes
the war work being done by schools in this country and others, and
gives practical suggestions for promoting the work in this country.
Conservation of food and other lessons in thrift, vocational education,
Red Cross and other community work, and reëducation of the
disabled are only a few of the important topics emphasized.</p>

<p>Eight inserts of photographic illustrations concretely visualize the
subject for the reader.</p>

<p>FOOD PROBLEMS</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">A. N. Farmer</span>, Superintendent of Schools, Evanston, Ill., and <span class="smcap">Janet
R. Huntington</span>, State Department of Public Instruction, Wis. 27 cents,
list price, or 20 cents, net, to boards of education, teachers, and schools;
carriage extra.</p></blockquote>

<p>This book aims to introduce lessons of thrift into the home by
utilizing the enormous influence of the schools upon national thought
and habit. It embodies in arithmetical problems of the most practical
nature principles upheld by the Food Administration. Where
the book has been studied it has been found to fulfill a two-fold purpose:
pupils have worked with greater energy and good will, and
both the children and their parents have attacked with more determination
the most important, the underlying, problem&mdash;food conservation.
To insure for this book the immediate and wide distribution
that it merits, Ginn and Company are offering it at an unusually
low price.</p>

<h2>INDUSTRIAL ARTS IN THE SCHOOL</h2>

<p>EXAMPLES OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Frank Mitchell Leavitt</span>, The University of Chicago. 330 pages, $1.25</p></blockquote>

<p>The movement for industrial education is a part of a recent great
educational advance. This volume discusses the history and practice
of the movement to bring about universal and appropriate education,
especially in its relation to existing social, economic, and educational
institutions. The author outlines a constructive plan for organization
of this type of education by public schools and gives many helpful suggestions
for bringing such organization into vital relation with the
present system. Full descriptions of existing classes and schools serve
as examples to illustrate the general principles of their classification.</p>

<p>FINE AND INDUSTRIAL ARTS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Walter Sargent</span>, The University of Chicago. 132 pages, illustrated, 75 cents</p></blockquote>

<p>The present wide acceptance of the manual arts as an important part
of general education is rapidly removing them from the class of special
subjects. The purpose of this book is to present some considerations
upon questions arising from this readjustment. The distinctive functions
of the various subjects taught under the head of manual arts, the
organization of progressive instruction, and reasonable standards of
attainment from year to year are among the subjects given careful consideration.
The book includes a survey of the progression of work in
the elementary grades, which forms the basis for the more detailed suggestions
which follow.</p>

<p>HOW CHILDREN LEARN TO DRAW</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Walter Sargent</span> and <span class="smcap">Elizabeth E. Miller</span>, The University of Chicago.
264 pages, illustrated, $1.00</p></blockquote>

<p>A new and decidedly fresh viewpoint is at once apparent in this
book, which treats drawing as a means of self-expression, as entirely
natural as talking or writing. The book combines, in subject matter,
theory as to what is to be accomplished, practical reports as to how
these aims have been accomplished, particularly in the Elementary
School of the School of Education (The University of Chicago), and
definite suggestions for improvement of methods. It will be found an
excellent volume for reading circles as well as for use in normal-training
classes and departments of education.</p>
